{"se0": {"text": "Shutdown of SSE and RWE plants comes before UK ban on coal-fired power from 2025\n\nThis article is more than 4 weeks old\n\nThis article is more than 4 weeks old\n\nThe energy corporations SSE and RWE have shut the door on coal-fired power generation by closing the Fiddler\u2019s Ferry power station in Warrington, Cheshire, and the Aberthaw coal plant in Wales after almost 50 years.\n\nThe Fiddler\u2019s Ferry power plant began generating enough electricity to power 2m homes in 1973 and is officially closing on Tuesday. The Aberthaw plant, which is slightly smaller and first began helping to power the UK electricity system in 1971, is shutting on the same day.\n\nThe shutdown of SSE and RWE\u2019s last remaining coal plants leaves only four remaining coal plants in the UK ahead of the government\u2019s ban on coal-fired power from 2025.\n\nSSE set out the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to close Fiddler\u2019s Ferry last summer, saying the plant was losing about \u00a340m a year and could not compete with the economics of modern gas-fired power stations and renewable energy.\n\nStephen Wheeler, the managing director of SSE\u2019s fossil fuel business, said the closure was a landmark moment for the company and the wider energy industry, as the UK moves towards a net zero carbon future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made a huge contribution to the local area, but it\u2019s the right thing to do as the UK continues to move to cleaner ways of producing energy and take action on climate change,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSSE is now the UK\u2019s leading generator of renewable energy and we have committed to trebling our output by 2030,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will back up this renewable generation with super-efficient gas-fired plants, which we are also looking to decarbonise through emerging carbon capture and hydrogen technology.\u201d\n\nThe FTSE 100 energy company expects to report a 25% jump in operating profits from its renewable energy business for last year after its Beatrice offshore windfarm began generating electricity at full power.\n\nAll of the UK\u2019s coal-fired power plants will need to shut by 2025 after the government called for a ban on burning coal for electricity, which typically produces double the carbon emissions compared with a gas-fired power plant.\n\nMany of the UK\u2019s remaining coal plants have decided to shut earlier than the deadline because the plants are considered uneconomic to run in the UK due to a government tax on carbon.\n\nCoal-fired electricity made up only 2.1% of the UK\u2019s total power mix last year, a dramatic fall from only four years ago when coal powered almost a quarter of the electricity system.\n\nBritain\u2019s dwindling fleet of coal plants still includes the West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal plants in Nottinghamshire, the Kilroot coal plant in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas.", "label": 0}, "se1": {"text": "The news that Rose Guiot had been dreading for the past decade was confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. South Cubbington Wood, which has been a feature in her life since she was a child, will be partially destroyed to make way for HS2.\n\n\u201cI was brought up here. It\u2019s always been home,\u201d the 70-year-old retired teacher said after walking past tractors camped just outside the ancient woodland. In the past 10 years, Guiot and a local campaign group, Cubbington Action Group Against HS2, have handed in petitions, gone on protests and attended select committee hearings to make arguments for alternative routes, such as building a tunnel underneath the woodlands; these plans were dismissed.\n\nThe news is all the harder to take because just six miles up the road, the potential impact of HS2 on a local golf club was \u201cvirtually eliminated\u201d following five years of negotiations. When HS2 was initially proposed, the route would have run across the eastern end of Kenilworth Golf Club course, but it has since been changed to run further east.\n\nThe golf club declined to comment, but its original petition on the subject read: \u201cThe loss of one hole on an 18-hole golf course will make the operation of the course unsustainable. Golf is a game played over 18 holes.\u201d\n\nFor some campaigners, the success of that approach contrasts sharply with South Cubbington Wood \u2013 and highlights a misguided set of priorities for the government. \u201cThey\u2019re telling us on one hand that woodland and nature is good for mental health, and then they\u2019re doing this. It\u2019s upsetting so many people,\u201d Guiot said. The woodlands, which are free and have far more biodiversity, are far more important than golf courses, she said.\n\nPeter Delow, who lives a ten minute walk from South Cubbington Wood, doesn\u2019t believe it should be framed as a choice between the woodlands or the golf course. The 71-year-old retired engineer has long argued that the high speed rail line that will travel through the countryside between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds should be cancelled entirely.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Cubbington Action Group Against HS2 has set up a protest camp in the woods after its arguments for alternative routes were all dismissed. Photograph: John Robertson/The Guardian\n\n\u201cOver the last ten years, I\u2019ve read countless documents on the project and written 400 blog posts on the matter and on all the grounds I\u2019ve looked at it, from transport, the environment and financial perspective, it doesn\u2019t actually make any sense,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Delow has accepted that his efforts to stop the project through parliament have failed, a group of activists have set up a protest camp to stop South Cubbington Wood being destroyed. Among the group was Martin Newman, an accountant, who said that as well as the environmental impact, the costs of the project were \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe cost has jumped from \u00a356bn in 2015 to as much as \u00a3106bn as of this month. It is a complete waste of money. We need investment in infrastructure, but it\u2019s concentrating that investment in a narrow area,\u201d he said, pointing to the fact the northern part of the railway line will likely be paused.\n\nBut for Lucy, who has worked for the past 15 years as a headhunter in global mega-projects, the railway is key to bridging the north-south divide and would be hugely beneficial for local businesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ageing infrastructure, as a lot of reports show. It costs a lot more to upgrade all the existing Victorian infrastructure than to build new routes.\u201d\n\nThe 37-year-old, who lives in Leamington Spa, added: \u201cWe used to be the forefront of the infrastructure, but if we don\u2019t invest, we will start to fall behind.\u201d She pointed to China, Japan and some European high speed rail as examples to emulate to kickstart the local economies in the north and Midlands, especially after Brexit.\n\nDarren Galloway, who is self-employed and lives in Nuneaton, echoed Lucy\u2019s points. The 40-year-old said: \u201cUnfortunately there are a lot of outdated and very narrow minded views from residents which do not allow for the development of the country let alone the area, for the benefit of the future generations.\u201d\n\nBut Penny McGregor, among the protestors at South Cubbington Wood, said there wasn\u2019t enough focus on the impact HS2 will have on local farmers. The high speed railway will go through a chunk of her father\u2019s farmland, which has impacted him both emotionally and financially, she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martin Newman (above) said the cost of the project was \u2018out of control\u2019.

Many farmers are in distress; there is a lot of depression and anxiety associated with this project,\u201d she said.\n\nMcGregor said that when she heard the news that the government had given the green light to the project, she felt like there was a dagger through her heart. \u201cIt\u2019s just a train for goodness sake, it\u2019s just a train.

In February, a research base in the Antarctic registered a temperature of more than 20C (68F) for the first time on the southern continent. At the other end of the world Qaanaaq, in Greenland, set an April record of 6C on Sunday.\n\nIn the first quarter, the heating was most pronounced in eastern Europe and Asia, where temperatures were 3C above average. In recent weeks, large parts of the US have sweltered. Last Friday, downtown Los Angeles hit an April high of 34C, according to the National Weather Service. Western Australia has also experienced record heat.\n\nIn the UK, the trend is less pronounced. The daily maximum UK temperature for April so far is 3.1C above average, with records set in Cornwall, Dyfed and Gwynedd.\n\nKarsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, said global warming was nudging closer to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. He said his online tracker showed a relatively conservative level of 1.14C of warming due to gaps in the data, but that this could rise to 1.17C or higher once the latest figures were incorporated.\n\nAlthough the pandemic has at least temporarily reduced the amount of new emissions, he said the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains a huge concern.\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis continues unabated,\u201d Haustein said. \u201cThe emissions will go down this year, but the concentrations keep on rising. We are very unlikely to be able to notice any slowdown in the built-up of atmospheric GHG levels. But we have the unique chance now to reconsider our choices and use the corona crisis as a catalyst for more sustainable means of transport and energy production (via incentives, taxes, carbon prices etc).\u201d\n\nThis was echoed by Grahame Madge, a climate spokesman for the Met Office: \u201cA reliance and trust in science to inform action from governments and society to solve a global emergency are exactly the measures needed to seed in plans to solve the next crisis facing mankind: climate change.\u201d", "label": 0}, "se3": {"text": "Students and laid-off bar and restaurant workers given jobs as pickers after urgent appeal\n\nScottish fruit farmers have solved a recruitment crisis that could have resulted in this year\u2019s harvest of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries being destroyed.\n\nSeveral thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nFarmers across the UK have said fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by lockdown measures that have prevented tens of thousands of workers from flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season.\n\nRecruitment agencies have proposed chartering special flights to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies.\n\nJames Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, an organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal had filled all their vacancies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a big response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.\u201d Many were students whose university courses had stopped and who normally had summer jobs.\n\nPorter said Scottish farms produced about 25% of the UK\u2019s soft fruit each year. Angus Growers members produced 12,400 tons of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries last year.\n\nPicking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, and picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had already begun. Picking would accelerate in May and peak from June onwards.\n\nHe said fruit picking was a skilled and demanding job, requiring speed, dexterity and knowledge about which fruit to pick. Migrant workers had been doing this work for 10 to 15 years, he said, and were extremely fast.\n\nNew recruits also needed to learn how to work safely with machinery and equipment, and maintain physical distancing while picking to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus.\n\nHe said it would take time and training for recruits to develop the skills his normal workforce had, and it was unclear whether the people who had signed up for this season\u2019s harvest would turn up or stay on if they found the job too demanding.\n\nLocal recruits may also leave if their old jobs return and universities resume teaching once the lockdown is relaxed, he added. \u201cA lot of things have to line up and work this summer.

Before the lockdown, half of all food and drink was consumed outside the home, and switching from supplying big catering companies and distributors has been proving difficult.\n\nBut some farmers and food entrepreneurs are finding now is their time to shine, and the environmental benefits \u2013 and the profits \u2013 may encourage more to follow suit.\n\nTwo years ago Neil Stephen, from Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, invested in self-service vending machines dispensing everything from farmhouse cheese and shortbread (baked by his mother), to joints of meat, whole chickens and fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\nHe was inspired by his grandfather who, in the late 1970s, used to leave a wheelbarrow at the gates of the family farm filled with turnips and cabbages, and an honesty box for people to pay.\n\nNow Stephen\u2019s investment is paying off, as people are attracted to a hygienic system where the goods are neatly packaged in portions in a refrigerated unit, behind glass doors. They punch in the number, pay by card and the windows open for them to collect the goods.\n\nSales at Thorneybank Farm Shop are up fivefold, Stephen reports. \u201cWe were rushed off our feet. It\u2019s worked phenomenally, it\u2019s been stratospheric.\u201d\n\nThe shop sells produce from neighbouring farmers, too, with asparagus and strawberries coming from six miles away, and eggs and dairy from three miles down the road. They can make better profit margins than they would selling to a big supermarket, without the hassle of door-to-door deliveries. The shop has a strong social media presence, and shoppers come from nearby Turriff town, while the city of Aberdeen is about 30 miles away.\n\nFishing is another industry hard hit by the Covid-19 crisis. In normal times, most of Britain\u2019s catch is destined for overseas markets, from China to Spain, where the species commonly caught in UK waters appeal to consumers\u2019 tastes. People in the UK have proved reluctant to move beyond cod, haddock and tuna, which mostly has to be imported.\n\nThe government has now announced \u00a31m for English fishermen to set up new ways to sell their catch and find local markets. There are already schemes for distributing fresh-caught fish directly, such as SoleShare in London and Call4Fish, a service that operates from Berwickshire to Cornwall.\n\nFood campaigners hope these services, where the fish on offer depends on what is caught by small boats, will encourage a more sustainable way of fishing, as consumers experiment with species less overfished than cod that might not previously have found a market.\n\nOne Londoner, Sebastien Sainsbury used to work in the investment banks that tower over Canary Wharf in London. Now he has a company, Plate to Crate, growing salad and other leafy greens in hydroponic towers in shipping containers, stacked up in air conditioned units under heat lamps with conditions carefully monitored.\n\nThe containers seem more like labs than farms, with workers kitted out in protective gear, from boot shields to hairnets, to prevent pests getting in. As a result, the lettuce, kale, pak choi and herbs are free from pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, and water use is 96% lower than in fields, with wastewater being used on local lawns.\n\nThe first harvest is due in May and, once all of the units are fully up and running, there could be 12 harvests a year, producing 15 to 18 tonnes from this site. Another will be producing soon in London\u2019s Elephant and Castle, where a development of 3,000 homes will receive salad weekly from containers.\n\nSainsbury believes this is the future of fresh produce for fussy Londoners. \u201cYounger people are more focused on where their food comes from, how fresh it is, what\u2019s in it.

About two-thirds of the fish were catfish and the rest were tilapia. The team say telltale marks on the bones reveal the fish were eaten by humans who used the shelter.\n\nIt is not the first time fish remains have been found in what are now dry regions of the desert, but the team say it is the first time the ancient climate of the region has been traced through animal remains.\n\n\u201cAll the other finds are surface finds, [from] just one layer, one period, one event. Whereas what we have here is a 5,000-year sequence with a lot of bones \u2013 so that makes it special,\u201d said Dr Wim van Neer from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, a co-author of the study.\n\nThe discovery is the latest in a string of finds from the large Takarkori rock shelter, a site, about 50-60 metres long and 30 metres high, that is thought to have been first used by hunter gatherers more than 10,000 years ago.\n\nProf Savino di Lernia, a co-author of the study from Sapienza University of Rome, said previous finds at the shelter included evidence of rock art, the earliest signs in Africa of wild cereals being cultivated and their seeds stored, and evidence from pottery shards of dairy practices in Africa dating back nearly 7,000 years ago.\n\nNaturally mummified human remains of Neolithic pastoralists have also been discovered at the shelter, while the uppermost layers of the site are composed of dung left by the animals of nomadic herders that later camped at the site between 5,900 and 4,650 years ago.\n\nWriting in the journal Plos One, Van Neer and colleagues report that fish account for about 80% of the animal remains discovered at the site during the 5,000-year period it was used by humans, with mammals making up just over 19%. Birds molluscs and other animals such as turtles account for the rest.\n\nThe team found the predominance of fish was not steady but fell from about 90% in the earliest layers to about 48% in those from the most recent period of its occupation.\n\n\u201cThe amount of fish is decreasing through time and the contribution of mammals increases, showing that people at Takarkori focussed gradually more on hunting and livestock keeping,\u201d the authors write. But, they add: \u201cIt is unclear if this was an intentional process or if this shift could be related to increasing aridity, which made the environment less favourable for fishes.\u201d\n\nThe findings chime with previous evidence from the Sahara, including from sediments and geological features, that have highlighted a shift in the climate from a wetter environment with vegetation and abundant lakes more than 10,000 years ago, to a period of fluctuating dry and wet conditions, until about 5,500 years ago the region became increasingly arid, resulting in the landscape seen today.\n\n\u201c[As it became drier] it is possible [there] was more distance that had to be covered to exploit these fish, and that is why we have a decrease,\u201d said Van Neer. \u201cPeople are opportunistic \u2013 if it is easy to get they take it.\u201d\n\nDr Clayton Magill of Heriot-Watt University, who was not part of the research team but previously explored climate change in the African savannah, said the shift to desert conditions in the Sahara region was one of the most remarkable ecological transitions in the Earth\u2019s recent past.\n\nThe new study, he said, showed that such large-scale climate change could affect species differently and increased our understanding of our human ancestors and their relationship with the climate. \u201c[The study] links climate change with changes in culture, whether related to subsistence strategies or social behaviour, thus marking a shift towards coupled human and natural landscapes in which humans are affected by and, in turn, affect their environments,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}, "se7": {"text": "Mark Constantine\u2019s beauty brand is in tune with the zeitgeist: so why is his ethical approach to capitalism not bearing fruit?\n\nThe badge on the lapel of Lush\u2019s co-founder, Mark Constantine, does the talking for him today as his beauty retail empire is buffeted by one crisis after another.\n\nA potential pandemic is \u201cclosing half the bloody world\u201d, he explains, as his lapel badge reads: \u201cFuck, fuck, fuckity fuck\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt the moment I have got no shops open in Hong Kong or Milan.

When the IOD is in positive mode, warmer waters develop off the Horn of Africa and cooler waters develop off Indonesia. This leads to hotter and drier weather in Australia.\n\nAn \u201cextreme positive\u201d event is when these conditions are particularly severe. Last year, an extreme positive IOD played a role in bushfires in Australia and floods in Africa.\n\nThe scientists used fossil and modern coral cores to examine how frequently these events occurred back to 1240. Analysing data from 500 of those years, they found an extreme positive Indian Ocean Dipole like the one Australia experienced in 2019 was rare, occurring just 10 times.\n\nLead author Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University , said four of the extreme positives were in the past 60 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen these events becoming more frequent and our climate models suggest that\u2019s a response to human-caused climate change,\u201d she said.\n\nThe strongest event on the instrumental record occurred in 1997.

But he can protect the Met Office. It is to get another \u00a31.2bn of public money for a \u201csupercomputer\u201d, just six years after getting \u00a397m for a previous one. There seems to be no headline-grabbing project for which this government is short of a billion.\n\nExcept for coastal surges, floods are about rivers. These have flooded throughout history, and there is no mystery as to why. It is called gravity. Rivers drain catchment areas into flood plains, moving water from uplands to lowlands. Variations in their behaviour are the result of the past planning of those same rivers and flood plains. Whatever may be the role of the climate emergency, blaming it is of no help to victims of today\u2019s flooding.\n\nBoris Johnson will not visit areas of UK hit by flooding, says No 10 Read more\n\nWhen Cockermouth in Cumbria was submerged in 2009, it was clear that a prime cause was the expedited drainage from Lake District hill farms to promote grazing pasture. When the Somerset Levels were flooded in 2014, a prime cause was the change of use of surrounding hills to growing high-density maize, exposing soil to runoff. Likewise, subsidised conifer plantations have everywhere debased vegetation and produced irregular spate rivers.\n\nPlay Video 0:57 Storm Dennis: cars swept away by flooding in Wales \u2013 video\n\nAs for building retaining walls to protect riverside communities, this merely shifts volume downstream. Here it meets the readiness of local planners to build houses in flood plains. The sprawl of housing estates is now urged on councils by a fanatically anti-planning government. As a drive across the aforementioned Somerset Levels will show, the result is acres of accidents waiting to happen. There is nothing a flood likes more than a good stretch of concrete.\n\nHence these floods are not acts of God, they are, in large measure, acts of government. For the most part, they are preventable by upland river management and lowland common sense. The National Trust responded to the Cockermouth disaster by slowing runoff from the hills, despite farmer opposition. The disaster has not been repeated. The rewilding movement seeks to promote variegated vegetation and retain water in peatland. Beaver reintroduction, now operating from Angus to Sussex to Devon, has shown remarkable results in damming streams and slowing flow. It can be done.\n\nIn other words the answer to flooding lies in a thousand frontline measures, aimed at correcting decades of foolish policies.

He and his wife hoped it would provide a decent income they could combine with their small pensions to fund a comfortable retirement.\n\nInstead, Howell, now 70, finds himself working long hours, deep in debt and earning less than $40,000 (\u00a330,654) in 2019 \u2013 well below the average US wage. He spoke to the Guardian about his situation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I do, I can\u2019t get above water. I do the same thing every time and the payout per flock can vary by as much as $8,000. Our output depends on their input.\u201d\n\n\n\nLike nearly 90% of US poultry producers Howell is not an independent farmer who can buy and sell his chickens to whoever he wants. He is contracted exclusively to Perdue Farms, one of the largest poultry companies in the US. The company, which produces a number of other agricultural products and services, generates more than $6bn a year in revenue.\n\nOver the past half century poultry farming in the US has become increasingly consolidated among a handful of companies. Tyson Foods, Pilgrim\u2019s Pride, Sanderson Farms, Koch Foods and Perdue control about 60% of the US chicken market. The companies own and operate all the means of production, including the feed mills, slaughterhouses, trucking lines and even the hatcheries that develop the best strains of chickens.\n\n\n\nIn the 1960s, poultry companies experimented with owning and operating chicken farms, but realised it was the least profitable, highest risk part of the supply chain. Instead they moved to the current system, persuading independent contracted farmers to take on this responsibility instead, and the system has reaped rich profits for those at the top. From 1981 to 2018, farm sales of chickens increased from $4.5bn to $31.7bn.\n\nIs the US chicken industry cheating its farmers? Read more\n\nBut contracts typically hand a remarkable amount of control to the parent company. In this case, Perdue maintains ownership of the birds, and the contract stipulates that farmers can only use feed, medication, vaccinations and other supplies provided by or arranged by Perdue. The contract also grants Perdue the authority to determine the breed of chickens produced, the numbers in each flock, the time allowed for processing each flock, and placement for future flocks.\n\nHowell and his fellow poultry farmers are so far from independent that in March 2018 the small business administration office of the Inspector General issued a report stating that most poultry farmers do not qualify as independent businesses eligible for loans from the agency because integrators exert so much control over them. \u201cThis control overcame practically all of a grower\u2019s ability to operate their business independent of integrator mandates,\u201d it concluded.\n\n\u201cThey [Perdue] call themselves a family farm, but they\u2019re a corporate farm.

Photograph: The Guardian\n\nIt\u2019s a system that has been criticised by farm support groups, because it prevents farmers from changing poultry producer or leaving the business due to the amount of debt accrued to get started and maintain the business.\n\n\n\nThe average estimated debt required to build one chicken house is $300,000, with farms usually containing at least four. The bank debts immediately lock producers into depending on their contract to meet repayments. Howell says he is also mandated to take on farm upgrades as required by the company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of long-term debt through a contract and a very high cost of exit. For the company, it\u2019s a short-term commitment. The farmers are at a huge disadvantage,\u201d said Scott Marlow, senior policy specialist at the Rural Advancement Foundation International-USA. \u201cBy the time the farmer pays initial debt, they have to buy new equipment so they never get out of debt, never get to the point where they\u2019re not in significant debt.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowell has little alternative but to stick with Perdue. In Robeson County, North Carolina, where he farms, there is only one other company, Mountaire Farms, to do business with, but the changes it would require to meet different standards would demand a massive amount of starter debt.\n\nPerdue told the Guardian that Sanderson Farms and Pilgrim Farms also operate in the area. In fact, as far as we could discover, Sanderson Farms only operates hatcheries and a processing plant, not chicken houses. Pilgrim Farms told the Guardian it does not operate any houses in the county.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a sense of hopelessness\u2019\n\nToday, the handful of companies controlling 90% of the poultry market in the US are currently under federal investigation over allegations they coordinated to fix prices. This price fixing makes it nearly impossible for individual farmers to survive independently without a niche or speciality market. Perdue declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\n\n\nDeveloping a niche market and trying to compete with Perdue is virtually impossible, says Craig Watts, a former contract grower with the company. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of hopelessness among farmers. Half a million dollars worth of debt makes a man very agreeable so they\u2019re not going to rock the boat too much.

Farmers who produce the most amount of weight with the least amount of feed receive the bonuses on top of base pay, while less efficient farmers have money deducted.\n\n\n\nHowell claims he is charged with the responsibility and costs of incinerating unusable birds in flocks provided by Perdue, but isn\u2019t compensated for the birds sent to him in poor condition. \u201cThey send us bad [low quality] feed out here, you get bad birds, they send us bad birds, we\u2019re going to get bad birds.

You listen to your flock supervisor throughout and then do poorly.

We shouldn\u2019t have to pay for birds that are given to us sick and it\u2019s been getting worse over the past year,\u201d he added.\n\nIn response, a Perdue spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cCulls and livability varies from farm to farm. Birds that are well cared for will generally have a higher livability and that has a lot to do with the management style on the farm. As part of our animal care initiative, we have put a lot of emphasis on identifying birds that are in pain or can\u2019t get to feed and water, and taking the proper measures.

Eventually, the authorities impounded their car and auctioned it off to cover the fines.\n\nBut the stunt attracted massive media attention, and the point was made. Soon after, electric vehicles were exempted from road tolls, one of a large raft of incentives that have, over the years, helped make Norway the country with the world\u2019s highest per capita electric vehicle ownership.\n\nLast month, in an economy hit by the coronavirus crisis, fully electric cars accounted for just under 60% of Norway\u2019s new car market, and plug-in hybrids just over 15% \u2013 meaning three in four of all new cars sold were either wholly or partly electric.\n\nIt still has some way to go, but the country looks on course to meet a government target \u2013 set in 2016, with full cross-party parliamentary support \u2013 of phasing out the sale of all new fossil-fuel based cars and light commercial vehicles by 2025.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite amazing how fast the mindset\u2019s changed,\u201d said Christina Bu of the Norwegian EV Electric Vehicle Association. \u201cEven in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric.\u201d\n\nThe story of how and why that has happened has a straightforward, if unexpected logic. First, despite being a major oil and gas producer, almost all of Norway\u2019s domestic energy comes from a single, and renewable, source: hydropower.\n\nEven in 2013 or 2014, people were sceptical. Now, a majority of Norwegians will say: my next car will be electric Christina Bu of the Norwegian EV Association\n\nThat means switching to EVs is a much greener option for Norway than for countries whose power is generated mostly by coal plants \u2013 and that if it wants to significantly reduce its emission levels, it has little choice but to green its transport sector.\n\nDriven by the environmental imperative, the government began offering incentives to buy and run electric cars as far back as 1990, first by introducing a temporary exemption from Norway\u2019s exorbitant vehicle purchase tax, which became permanent six years later.\n\n\u201cThis was an important step,\u201d Bu said. \u201cNorway was a very poor country before we discovered oil; cars were a luxury item. They\u2019ve always been taxed very highly. Cars in Norway are a lot more expensive than elsewhere. Without the purchase tax, the cost of an electric car basically fell to that of an ordinary car.\u201d\n\nSince then, electric car drivers have been given the right to park for free in some municipal car parks, drive in bus lanes, take ferries without a ticket and, thanks to A-ha, drive toll-free. They are not required to pay VAT on their cars, or road tax, and company electric cars are taxed at a lower rate than petrol or diesel vehicles.\n\nSome measures have changed over the years: to be allowed to drive in a bus lane, for example, you now need to be carrying a passenger. A so-called 50% rule was introduced in 2017, allowing local authorities to charge EV drivers up to 50% of the parking fees, road tolls and ferry rates applicable to fossil-fuel vehicles.\n\nBut overall, said Bu, the \u201ccombination of a big one-off saving when you buy the car, plus the substantially lower costs \u2013 fuel, tolls, parking, maintenance \u2013 of actually driving it, still adds up to a very powerful financial argument. Over its lifetime, you really save a lot of money with an electric car in Norway.\u201d\n\nThat was certainly what persuaded Wenche Charlotte Egelund, 57, who bought a VW Golf Electric with her partner two years ago when they moved out of central Oslo. \u201cThe incentives were crucial,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tax and VAT exemptions, free municipal parking, free toll roads that mean we avoid the rush-hour traffic jams.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest EV charging stations at Kongens Gate near Akershus Festning in Oslo.

Financially, it was like there was no other sensible option. I do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?\u201d\n\nRachel Ritman, 56, a postwoman living on the outskirts of Fredrikstad, bought her Opel Ampera two years ago and said she has not regretted her choice, even if she was \u201cnot sure we would have gone electric without the incentives\u201d. The car\u2019s range was good, she said: 250 miles (400km) in summer, 200 miles (320km) in winter and because she charges at home she does not suffer from \u201clade-angst\u201d, or the fear of running out of juice.\n\nBoth Ritman and Egelund have a second, diesel-powered car for extra-long journeys, to country cabins or holidays. Sten Br\u00e5then, 55, a media consultant, bought his Nissan Leaf as a second car \u201cfor taking the children around and driving to work. But there were so many advantages that when we were getting a new main car last year we didn\u2019t think twice about going electric.\u201d\n\nGovernment incentives were vital in the decision to buy, Br\u00e5then said: \u201cI think we would have managed without the other incentives \u2013 free toll roads and parking \u2013 but the actual cost of buying was so much lower than ordinary cars here in Norway.\u201d He warned, though, that Norway was going to need more charging stations.\n\nDespite the incentives, EV sales in Norway remained low until about 2010, when a number of smaller, more affordable electric cars from makers such as Mitsubishi and Nissan came to market, and improved technology meant larger electric cars began to offer both the space and range to make them a sensible choice for families.\n\nI do wonder whether it really is as green as we are told. Is a car running on clean diesel really worse than the environmental impact of producing an EV battery?

Many Norwegians on lower incomes can only dream of owning an electric car, and three out of four car purchases are on the secondhand market.\n\nBu \u2013 whose organisation represents consumers rather than producers \u2013 rejected this, arguing that \u201cwe have to change the cars we drive, and the only way to do that is to change the new cars. We can\u2019t change used ones\u201d. EVs will soon make up 10% of Norway\u2019s passenger fleet, she said, and are slowly coming on to the used market.\n\nShe said she was confident for the future of electric vehicles, even in countries without a big renewable power sector, and studies show that EVs running on power generated from fossil fuel are responsible for roughly the same level of overall CO 2 emissions as petrol cars.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we clearly have to do two things,\u201d she said. \u201cProduce more renewable energy and products \u2013 like cars \u2013 that can run on it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to do both, as fast as possible.

The latter have become regular visitors. Watching the skill with which they hunt is a real privilege, aided by the fact that they seem very happy to fly in broad daylight. We do sometimes feel like frauds when watching wildlife diaries at the end of David Attenborough, as they explain the trials and tribulations of capturing footage.

Some had been punctured by a single hole, others riddled like a pepperpot, a sign of multiple occupancy.

His skin is bumpy and moist, the colour of pebbles at the bottom of a river when dappled sun hits them. Olaf\u2019s eyes are deep amber. His body lifts and falls with each breath. \u201cThe males get really pretty,\u201d says Barber, ectotherms curator at Fort Worth zoo in Texas. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll turn a solid yellow when they\u2019re in breeding form.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, this toad shouldn\u2019t exist at all. He is the progeny of an egg from a captive mother and sperm from a wild father \u2013 a hybrid from parents who were both dead. Olaf is not the first amphibian to be born via IVF \u2013 that has been happening for years \u2013 but he is the first to be born from sperm that was frozen and thawed.\n\n\u201cWe were able to recover a genetic lineage that had disappeared, so we were able to produce an offspring from dead parents,\u201d says Andy Kouba, an ecologist at Mississippi State University, who assisted with the project. \u201cSo that was an exciting first, to reintroduce genetic lines back into the population.\u201d\n\nScientists have a lot of tools to conserve species, says Kouba, but they still need to hedge against extinction in the wild. One way could be to bank the genetic lineages of species by freezing sperm and egg deposits and then later thawing and combining them in a dish to create offspring.\n\nAmphibians are at the forefront of an uphill battle against extinction, losing a greater proportion of species than any other vertebrate group. The IUCN estimates that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction. Habitat loss, climate crisis and a fungal disease all play a role in their demise.\n\nBut amphibians are not the only species that can benefit from new technologies. In vitro fertilisation, hormone therapy and cryopreservation are increasingly being used as tools for conservation \u2013 for amphibians and beyond. In a fast-changing world, frozen zoos may be the places where tissues are kept, in the hope of boosting numbers or resurrecting species in the future.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest It is estimated that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction. Photograph: Fort Worth Zoo\n\nFrozen zoos\n\nHow did Olaf come to exist at all? A year ago in Puerto Rico, researchers captured six male toads, injected them with hormones and then collected the sperm they ejected when they urinated. The toads usually pee when picked up by humans, but the researchers also barked at them, Kouba explains, as toads urinate when frightened, and dogs barking are a sure-fire way to scare them. The males were then released back into the wild.\n\nThe team of international scientists preserved the semen in liquid nitrogen and transported it to Fort Worth zoo, where female toads were injected with hormones to release eggs. Olaf and his roommates were created in a dish, eliciting cheers from the scientists when they hatched from their eggs.\n\nThe idea of creating a frozen zoo first emerged in the 1970s, when a medical pathologist named Kurt Benirschke started banking animal sperm and eggs at San Diego zoo in the same way that human gametes were starting to be stored: in giant vials of liquid nitrogen that dropped the temperature of the materials to -196 F. When Benisrschke started banking genetic material, no technology existed to make use of it, but he believed it was important to carry on anyway.\n\nNow, biobanks for animal species \u2013 from fish to reptiles to birds and even snails and molluscs \u2013 are popping up around the globe. The Frozen Zoo repository at San Diego zoo holds more than 10,000 cell cultures from nearly 1,000 different species. They are mostly from mammals, but also from birds, reptiles and amphibians.\n\nDeadly skin-eating fungal disease wipes out 90 amphibian species in 50 years Read more\n\nScientists had been working on the process of bringing together sperm and egg outside the bodies of animals like rabbits and guinea pigs since the 1870s. But making babies in a test tube is no simple task because every species is different. IVF success rates for mammals are much higher than with reptiles, and with some species, it\u2019s incredibly low. Even within species, some cells are more difficult than others. When it comes to amphibians, Kouba says, their sperm is pretty simple to freeze \u2013 but eggs are not, because they are so much larger than the sperm. \u201cInside that cell, you have water content, and when you start to freeze anything with water, they form ice crystals that rupture the cell.\u201d\n\nBecause fish such as salmon and cod are widely available commercially, they have been studied much more than amphibians, and amphibian researchers like Barber and Kouba are waiting for breakthroughs that they can adopt. \u201cThere is a huge interest in freezing sperm to move genetics around the world for commercially viable species,\u201d Kouba says.\n\nOne reason that conservationists want to boost the numbers of amphibian populations is because diseases are devastating them in the wild. Kouba says cryopreservation has a place as a last-ditch effort to bank the remaining genetic material from a dying species, but that it is really better to take action before a species\u2019 numbers have crashed. \u201cWe can produce tens of thousands for reintroduction, which may allow a species to return to a healthy population,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s because amphibians have a naturally high mutation rate, so sending thousands of amphibians into the wild to mate and repopulate could mean they create a disease-resistant strain on their own. \u201cYou release animals with the hope that disease resistant lines will develop, and those animals will reproduce,\u201d says Kouba.\n\nHealthy herds\n\nIn Colorado, Jennifer Barfield is using IVF to create bison with healthy genes to introduce into existing wild herds. Left to their own devices, bison breed well but what they can\u2019t do is move around the globe \u2013 so to transport new genes to different areas requires the use of IVF.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jennifer Barfield has helped establish the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd. Photograph: William A Cotton/CSU Photography\n\nUsing assisted reproductive technologies, she has helped produce healthy Yellowstone bison from ones that had a bacterial disease called brucellosis and established a new conservation herd in Colorado called the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.\n\nThere is another advantage to using IVF in bison says Barfield. \u201cBio-banking the genetic preservation is just a good idea, like a form of genetic insurance. You never know how science will advance to use that material in the future.\u201d\n\nShe says that one of the challenges in endangered species is that often researchers don\u2019t know enough about the reproductive physiology of rare animals to apply solutions before the animals become extinct. \u201cYou can\u2019t experiment on endangered species,\u201d says Barfield.\n\nIn some species, assisted reproduction is the last hope. There are only two remaining northern white rhinos left in the world, both female, both past reproductive age. Last year, researchers were able to harvest eggs from one of the females and have created three embryos with frozen sperm from dead males. The embryos are now frozen, with the hope of implanting them into surrogate southern white rhino females later this year. The eventual goal is to create five animals that could live in the wild in Africa \u2013 a plan that could take decades to come to fruition.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The first calf in the world to be conceived via IVF using eggs and sperm from Yellowstone bison, in Soapstone Prairie Natural Area, Colorado. Photograph: William A Cotton/CSU Photography\n\nBack at Fort Worth zoo, Barber carefully puts Olaf back in his cage in the isolation room. In the wild, Puerto Rican crested toads like Olaf spend 95% of their time in small holes between crushed rocks, coming out to feed at night and when it rains. In his home at the zoo, the staff have constructed small pyramids made from sections of white PVC pipes for Olaf and the other toads to hang out in. Of the toads that used to live in this room, 193 were recently shipped via FedEx back to Puerto Rico for reintroduction; now more are being raised here. Other rooms house frogs raised from other parts of North America, all in need of a population boost.\n\nBarber says that in the 1980s zoos thought of themselves as arks. \u201cThat was kind of the buzz word for zoos: we\u2019re becoming arks instead of just having animals for exhibit. We need to start doing more about thinking about conservation and maintaining species long term.\u201d\n\nBut those arks are full, and more species need assistance \u2013 there\u2019s no space to keep animals just as an insurance policy. \u201cWe\u2019re not arks, we\u2019re life rafts,\u201d Barber says. \u201cAnd we have very limited seating.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The insemination of an egg from one of the last two remaining female northern white rhinos using frozen sperm at the Avantea laboratory in Cremona, Italy. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP\n\nAs she speaks about her passion for overlooked species, Barber\u2019s eyes fill with emotion. \u201cEspecially with the stuff that I work with \u2013 the creepy crawlies \u2013 most people wonder: why should we care? And it\u2019s like, well, we should care about everything because we\u2019re all connected. Sometimes it\u2019s just really hard to communicate why we should care and why it is our responsibility to try to mitigate things that we humans have caused.\u201d\n\nSo far, IVF conservation work is only being done with about 10 species \u2013 but Kouba predicts it will become much more widespread in the next decade. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to become mainstream,\u201d he says, adding that it could become a primary resource for conservation. \u201cWe left those species in the world and we were able to collect their material, bring it back and put new founder lines back in the population, so we don\u2019t need to remove animals from the wild any more.\n\n\u201cThat will revolutionise how we manage wildlife.\u201d\n\nThis story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Not our current predicament \u2013 although, in low moments, it may sometimes feel that way. No, this is the \u201cgather\u201d, a ritualised round-up where Lake District shepherds sweep the local peaks to coax a diffuse flock back home for the mutton equivalent of an MOT.\n\nBBC Four\u2019s documentary film The Great Mountain Sheep Gather was hardly the usual splashy Easter blockbuster premiere, yet it was probably the most restorative thing screened over the holiday weekend. The perennial One Man and his Dog aside, this was also the biggest herding-related TV event since ITV\u2019s Flockstars in 2015, that ill-fated attempt to turn sheepdog trials into a celebrity circus.\n\nThe Great Mountain Sheep Gather took a notably loftier approach, using unhurried aerial drone footage to help communicate the sheer scale of the task facing local shepherd Andrew Harrison and his roving team of dogs. These sweeping but pleasingly languid shots of flinty beauty were interspersed with short stanzas of poetry written by Mark Pajak and read by Maxine Peake.\n\nThe result was a film overflowing with lush but hardscrabble beauty that seemed to model itself on the wandering rhythms of the gather itself, with long sections of contemplative silence \u2013 or at least what passes for silence on the fells. There was always a soothing pastoral underscore of birdsong and the occasional plaintive bleat. In marked contrast to online discourse, every \u201cmeh\u201d made my heart leap.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The sheep make it down off the hills. Photograph: Screengrab/BBC/Windfall Films\n\nA lifelong farmer, Harrison has England\u2019s highest mountain, Scafell Pike, on his patch and his 500-strong flock of Herdwick sheep were self-reliant enough to scatter themselves all over its vertiginous facets. To this layman\u2019s tired eyes, they also seemed much harder to spot than other breeds, sporting thick woollen coats of various shades of grey, off-white and even dark chocolate brown.\n\nEquipped with a crook, Adidas joggers and a bodycam, Harrison was up before 4am to ascend to his preferred starting position. Even though this was a July morning, the elevated terrain was girdled in thick fog. As the shepherd advanced through the murk \u2013 the drone camera floating obediently at heel behind him \u2013 he would occasionally be obscured from sight, giving this doc the unexpected and phantasmagorical feel of a pagan horror movie.\n\nIf the God\u2019s-eye view from the drone showcased the Lake District landscape in all its brooding beauty, there was also the chance to sample the mossy, mulchy experience at ground-level. A sheep-cam thrust you into the stop-start bustle of the expanding herd, with all the snuffling and rustling you might expect. Footage harvested from Harrison\u2019s bodycam simulated the sensation of striding purposefully across the moors or dipping abruptly into a brook to slake your thirst. In one memorable lull, he rested against a handy rock and the POV shot was dominated by his hands deftly rolling up a ciggie: the world\u2019s most scenic fag break.\n\nIt was not all quiet contemplation and communing with nature. By halfway through, Harrison and his indefatigable dogs \u2013 now bolstered by some fellow herders \u2013 had rounded up a considerable flock requiring constant attention to direct over the unpredictable terrain. We learned of \u201ctrods\u201d, narrow paths favoured by sheep but yet to show up on any OS map, and felt the shared relief of navigating every animal safely through the fell gate, after which the bleak wildness gradually gave way to fields and paddocks more visibly shaped by man.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bringing the flock safely home: the sheep all accounted for at the farmhouse. Photograph: Screengrab/BBC/Windfall Films\n\nThe Great Mountain Sheep Gather was presumably commissioned ages ago, certainly long before we all became so unfortunately familiar with the phrase \u201cherd immunity\u201d. While not quite Slow TV, it does feel like a conscious attempt to tap into the renewed interest surrounding the traditional words and ways of the UK countryside spearheaded by the work and advocacy of Robert Macfarlane.

Coronavirus-induced lockdown is changing the daily rhythm of urban life, shining a light on emboldened animals that usually prefer to remain hidden.\n\nBiologists and ecologists normally feel more at home studying remote jungles or inaccessible mountain tops, where \u201creal\u201d nature is. But as our planet gets covered with cities, more and more environments are being run by humans, who have become a super keystone species.\n\nQ&A What is wild cities week? Show Hide This week, the Guardian's Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads. Around 55% of the world\u2019s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Nature\u2019s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.\n\nIn this special series of reports we'll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.\n\nCities are not mausoleums for nature but modern-day versions of the Galapagos archipelago, according to Menno Schilthuizen, author of Darwin Comes to Town, a book about contemporary evolution in cities where rapid changes can be observed within a human lifetime.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A mother and two wild boar piglets cross a street in the Carmel neighbourhood of Haifa, Israel, on 11 April. Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA\n\n\u201cOnly in our flights of fancy can we still keep nature divorced from the human environment. Out in the real world, our tentacles entwine nature\u2019s fabric,\u201d Schilthuizen writes. \u201cWhile we have been trying to save the world\u2019s crumbling pre-urban ecosystems, we have been ignoring the fact that nature has already been putting up the scaffolds to build novel, urban ecosystems for the future.\u201d\n\nHaunting images of wolves, bison and bears living in deserted towns following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster indicate what happens when humans leave a place for good. The coronavirus lockdown shows how quickly wildlife closes in. \u201cIt is interesting to consider how fragile our urban environment is. If we\u2019re not constantly present, it\u2019s being taken over by nature very quickly,\u201d says Schilthuizen, who is professor of evolutionary biology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nThe unique thing about coronavirus is that it is causing multiple cities across the globe to simultaneously go into hibernation. This gives ecologists an insight into how humans change urban biodiversity in multiple locations. \u201cAnimals are nearby, constantly watching us from the outskirts and the forests, and as soon as our presence seems to be abating they start exploring where new terrain could be won \u2026 It makes you aware of how we\u2019re constantly competing with many species,\u201d says Schilthuizen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Two silvery-brown tamarin or grey titi monkeys in Medellin, Colombia, on 16 April. Photograph: Joaqu\u00edn Sarmiento/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA messy business\n\nHistorically, urban environments have been seen as too contaminated by humans to teach us anything important about biodiversity. In the past few decades this has started to change but we still know little about the urban wildlife we live alongside, says Rana El-Sabaawi, associate professor of biology at Canada\u2019s University of Victoria.\n\n\u201cIf you look in the literature, the field of urban ecology doesn\u2019t really come into its own until the last decade or two. Before that there were a smattering of papers and reports, mostly descriptions of biodiversity trends in and around specific cities. In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that explain biodiversity in the city,\u201d she says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A puma in the streets of Santiago, 24 March 2020. Photograph: Andres Pina/ATON CHILE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUrban environments are messy places (full of lights, pollution and people pursuing their own interests), which makes studying them difficult. It\u2019s all very well to observe animals and plants in urban places, but understanding how these different processes fit together is more problematic.\n\nAt the same time, there is increasing recognition that few places on Earth are free from human influence \u2013 there is a plastic bag at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, and Antarctica\u2019s remote glaciers are flecked with microplastics. Understanding places where humans interact with nature most should help planners and developers create cities that hold as much wildlife as possible.\n\nOpportunists do well in cities\n\nBroadly speaking, \u201csensitive\u201d species, whose habitat is destroyed by urban developments, are unlikely to venture into urban areas. \u201cOpportunists\u201d, which have a much broader diet and high tolerance for noise and pollution, are more at home. Coronavirus means species that might lie in the grey area between these categories are now more likely to venture into previously unexplored urban areas.\n\nRacoons, pigeons, foxes, gulls and crows are opportunists and considered a nuisance by many humans who live alongside them. Animals such as these, which scavenge human rubbish to get food, are likely to be struggling during lockdown.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A racoon walks over the running path in almost deserted Central Park in Manhattan, 16 April 2020. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images\n\nRing-necked parakeets might disperse away from urban parks and forage on agricultural land instead. Residents of the East Riding in Yorkshire have been warned seagulls could be more aggressive because there are fewer seaside day-trippers feeding them leftover chips. In Amsterdam, even coots \u2013 which sometimes line their nests with plastic \u2013 may have a tough time finding replacement materials.\n\n\u201cOften what happens when food supply runs short is increased competition and aggression between animals,\u201d says El-Sabaawi. \u201cThere have already been fascinating reports from Asia about monkey \u2018brawls\u2019 caused by food shortages. If the food shortages are really severe and extended, then populations might decline.\u201d\n\nOther animals seem to be doing well with fewer people on the street. Urban songbirds, for example, can communicate more easily when the din of background traffic is reduced. Deer, badgers and wild boar might be emboldened to start pinching food from suburban gardens or roadsides.

Lockdown will probably have a similar effect on wildlife populations as an exceptionally wet or hot year \u2013 provided things return to how they were.\n\nIn terms of wildlife sightings during this period, it\u2019s hard to separate fact, fiction and wishful thinking \u2013 it\u2019s a complex picture and new research is starting to try to make sense of what is happening. Scientists have launched a Silent Cities project to look at the diversity of sounds in places normally masked by anthropogenic noise. People are being encouraged to record sounds in \u201cordinary\u201d suburban/urban spaces such as in a backyard or on a balcony during lockdown, and compare it to noises when things are back to normal.\n\nCities are also powerhouses for permanent changes. For example, there are distinct subspecies of mosquitoes found on the London underground that no longer hibernate and feed on human blood as opposed to bird blood, according to research published in Nature in 1999. Even more remarkable, mosquitoes living on different tube lines do not mix so the population living on the Circle line is genetically different to those living on the Piccadilly line. This change happened over 100 generations or so \u2013 significantly faster than Charles Darwin thought possible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A hungry seagull tries to open up a garbage bag at via Fori Imperiali, Rome, Italy, 9 April 2020. Photograph: Stefano Montesi - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nUrban blackbirds are also morphing into a new species, according to Schilthuizen. Across European and north African cities, blackbirds living in urban areas have developed shorter bills (probably thanks to an abundance of bird feeders and easier pickings in cities). Traffic noise has caused urban blackbirds to sing in the night when it\u2019s quieter, and they also breed around a month earlier than their countryside cousins.\n\nScientists think the urban blackbird, Turdus urbanicus, could be the first of many species to adapt to life in the city. Schilthuizen writes: \u201cThe pace of evolution is set by ecological opportunities that emerge from human interactions \u2026 In those pressure cookers of environmental change, species will need to speed up their evolution or become extinct.\u201d\n\nPlants tell the history of our cities\n\nChanges in botany have been massive in the past decade with huge shifts in wild plants living in urban areas, according to London-based botanist Dr Mark Spencer. \u201cPlants have lived with us in our cities for thousands of years and they move along with us and they tell stories about us,\u201d he says.\n\nLondon is an important focal point for the arrival of non-native species in the UK, either arriving accidentally by international trade (via wool, for example) or escapees from domestic horticulture. Cities are the first pitstop for species that could later spread around the whole country.\n\nFor example, loquat (a common cousin of plums, cherries and apricots) is becoming established in London where Greek and Turkish communities typically live because people spit out the pips on the ground after they\u2019ve eaten the fruit. And now it\u2019s starting to sprout in the wild.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Himalayan balsam (impatiens glandulifera) flourishes in Devon, UK. Photograph: Papilio/Alamy\n\nWidespread non-native plants such as Himalayan balsam, buddleia and Japanese knotweed were originally imported for horticulture. \u201cThe detailed research on the entry points of these well-established non-native species is not done,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cIn this country, we have a focus on doing biological and ecological research on nice pristine chalk grasslands \u2013 which are wonderful habitats. We don\u2019t like getting down and dirty with weird and wonderful street pavements. That\u2019s pretty much it, putting it in crass terms. Urban areas are very poorly understood.\u201d\n\nLike animals, plants also adapt to city life. Crepis sancta, a widely spread Mediterranean member of the daisy family, has moved into Montpellier in France. In 12 years the seeds have evolved to be larger and heavier so they are more likely to fall into soil near their parent plant rather than on concrete which covers most of the city. Lighter seeds were 55% less likely to germinate, researchers found.\n\n\u201cOrdinary\u201d urban areas are places we desperately need to understand, Spencer says. \u201cA lot of this stuff is not about traipsing around recording hyper-rarities or incredible orchids, it\u2019s about getting the common and the widespread.\u201d\n\nPeople sending in samples of species can help researchers collect more accurate records about changes in botany. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve been trying to do for the past decade or so in natural history is get past this idea that it\u2019s elite, purely expert, frankly old, white, male, grey tops that can do it, and no one else can. Actually, the only way you get past this is by supporting people,\u201d says Spencer, who encourages people to submit plant sightings to i-record.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ducks in the fountains almost outnumber people in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square on 15 April. Photograph: Emerson Utracik/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWill lockdown change how people interact with nature? Probably not, says Schilthuizen. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the quiet. I keep thinking to myself, this is the way things should be, without constant air traffic overhead and without constant noise of traffic and throngs of people spending money on the streets \u2026 But I think we have a short memory. The bliss of a quiet period \u2013 or the memory of that period \u2013 will disappear quite quickly.\u201d\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\n\n\u2022 A picture caption was amended on 30 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the young of wild boar as cubs.

That\u2019s absolutely a priority,\u201d he said.

In an open letter, she said it failed to respect the goal of capping global heating at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 an aspiration the EU signed up to in the 2015 Paris agreement.\n\nShe repeated that message at a meeting with MEPs on the European parliament\u2019s environment committee on Wednesday. \u201cIn November 2019 the European parliament declared a climate and environment emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cYou stated that yes, the house is actually burning, this was no false alarm, but then you went back inside, finished your dinner and watched your movie and went to bed without even calling the fire department.\n\n\u201cWhen your house is on fire you don\u2019t wait a few more years to start putting it out, and yet this is what the commission are proposing today.\u201d\n\nEarlier at a private meeting with EU commissioners the teenage activist was told by Timmermans that the movement she started was the reason the European Green Deal and climate law exists.\n\nQ&A What is the EU climate law? Show Hide European Union leaders in 2019 agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning more emissions will be removed than expelled into the atmosphere. The climate law proposed by the European commission makes that 2050 promise legally-binding. If an EU member state fails to make progress, the commission can take it to the European court of justice, which has the power to impose hefty daily fines for non-compliance. The commission, the body that drafts and enforces EU law, describes the draft regulation as revolutionary, because all EU legislation \u2013 whether farming, energy or transport \u2013 will have to be consistent with the 2050 climate target. Climate campaigners, notably Greta Thunberg who described the law as \u201csurrender\u201d, argue that it does not go far enough to reduce emissions in the next decade \u2013 a critical window if the world is to avoid climate breakdown that will come from overshooting the aspiration agreed at the 2015 Paris climate talks to keep warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The climate law does not include an emissions-reduction target for 2030, although the commission will table a proposal in September. EU governments are likely to object to the powers the commission wants to give itself to propose climate targets for 2035, 2040 and 2045. Under the powerful legal tool of \u201cdelegated acts\u201d, the EU executive would be able to set targets with limited input from ministers and MEPs. That could prove tricky with governments and the European parliament, who must approve the climate law before it comes into force.\n\n\n\nThe climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said the EU was aiming too low and its current targets on reducing emissions set in 2014 were not in line with the 1.5C goal.\n\nAn IPCC report in 2018 showed that going beyond 1.5C, even by half a degree, would significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people.\n\nVan Ypersele said the EU should be aiming for carbon neutrality one decade earlier. \u201cIf a region as technologically rich, as scientifically rich as the EU is only able to achieve that by 2050 how can you imagine that the rest of the world will do that by the same year?

Campaigners have been concerned about a shaky start, with the new Cop26 president \u2013 the business secretary, Alok Sharma \u2013 only appointed three weeks ago, after his predecessor was abruptly sacked.

The bug not only breaks the plastic down but uses it as food to power the process.\n\nThe bacterium, which was found at a waste site where plastic had been dumped, is the first that is known to attack polyurethane. Millions of tonnes of the plastic is produced every year to use in items such as sports shoes, nappies, kitchen sponges and as foam insulation, but it is mostly sent to landfill because it it too tough to recycle.\n\nWhen broken down it can release toxic and carcinogenic chemicals which would kill most bacteria, but the newly discovered strain is able to survive. While the research has identified the bug and some of its key characteristics, much work remains to be done before it can be used to treat large amounts of waste plastic.\n\n\u201cThese findings represent an important step in being able to reuse hard-to-recycle polyurethane products,\u201d said Hermann Heipieper, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ in Leipzig, Germany, who is one of the research team. He said it might be 10 years before the bacterium could be used at a large scale and that in the meantime it was vital to reduce the use of plastic that is hard to recycle and to cut the amount of plastic in the environment.\n\nMore than 8bn tonnes of plastic has been produced since the 1950s and most has ended up polluting the world\u2019s land and oceans, or in landfill dumps. Scientists say it threatens a \u201cnear permanent contamination of the natural environment\u201d.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology, identified a new strain of Pseudomonas bacteria, a family known for its ability to withstand harsh conditions, such as high temperatures and acidic environments.\n\nThe researchers fed it key chemical components of polyurethane in the laboratory. \u201cWe found the bacteria can use these compounds as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy,\u201d Heipieper said.\n\nFungi has been used before to break down polyurethane, but bacteria are much easier to harness for industrial use. Heipieper said the next step would be to identify the genes that code for the enzymes produced by the bug that break down the polyurethane.\n\nScientists revealed in 2018 that they had accidentally created a mutant enzyme that breaks down plastic drinks bottles, which are made of PET, potentially enabling the complete recycling of bottles for the first time. One of the team behind this advance, Prof John McGeehan, the director of the Centre for Enzyme Innovation at the University of Portsmouth, England, praised the new work.\n\n\u201cThe breakdown of certain polyurethanes can release toxic additives, which need to be handled carefully. This research group has discovered a strain that can tackle some of these chemicals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile there is still much work to be done, this is exciting and necessary research that demonstrates the power of looking to nature to find valuable biocatalysts. Understanding and harnessing such natural processes will open the door for innovative recycling solutions.\u201d\n\nHeipieper said: \u201cWhen you have huge amounts of plastic in the environment, that means there is a lot of carbon and there will be evolution to use this as food.

The aim is to increase consumer demand and thus halt any otherwise expected fall.\u201d\n\nA campaign in favour of the Dutch veal sector to promote the meat of calves in the Belgian, Italian and French markets received a \u20ac6m subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe veal market has been declining since the 2000s,\u201d says a description of the project on the commission website. \u201cThere are various reasons for this: the economic crisis, changes in consumption behaviour and above all a lack of top-of-mind awareness. France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy are minded to fight this fall in consumption by boosting the image consumers have of European veal.\u201d\n\nSjoerd van de Wouw, a researcher at Wakker Dier foundation, said the funding policy was outdated indefensible. \u201cWe understand that you need to consider the interests of producers but not by completing ignoring the interests of consumers and the climate,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response, a European commission spokesman said: \u201cThe selection of projects is based on a strict and defined procedure involving external evaluators. The producers\u2019 organisations send proposals regarding their campaign ideas and also participate in the funding of the campaigns.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to constantly evaluate and adjust its existing policy, the commission will soon launch a public consultation on the EU promotion policy for agricultural products.\u201d", "label": 0}, "se31": {"text": "Those made homeless have been told it could be up to nine months before they can return\n\nThis article is more than 1 month old\n\nThis article is more than 1 month old\n\nThree weeks after the Rhondda Fach river overflowed and water coursed into 14 homes around the Avon Terrace Bridge in the village of Ynyshir, the cleanup remains in its early stages.\n\nThick black mud still coats some floors, and heaters and dehumidifiers hum as the effort to dry out walls and window frames continues.

Some companies were required to offset their excess emissions; they paid $863,860 in total.\n\nSmoke screen: how Australia's biggest polluters have been free to increase emissions Read more\n\nGavan McFadzean, ACF\u2019s climate change program manager, said not requiring industrial polluters to pay for CO 2 left Australian taxpayers to \u201cpick up the tab\u201d through the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund.\n\n\u201cThis is real pollution entering the atmosphere \u2013 pollution we can\u2019t bring back, pollution that is heating the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, everyone will pay for this, whether it\u2019s through losing a home to unseasonal bushfires, through food shortages as a result of worse droughts, or through not having coral reefs to appreciate.\u201d\n\nThe safeguard mechanism was announced by the then environment minister Greg Hunt in 2015. He said it would put \u201ca limit on the emissions that individual firms can have\u201d to ensure cuts paid for by taxpayers through the emissions reduction fund were not just wiped out by increases \u201cabove business-as-usual levels\u201d elsewhere.\n\nIn practice, companies have regularly applied for and been granted higher limits, or baselines. It has prompted some business representatives and climate campaigners to question the point of the scheme.\n\nThe data released last week shows industrial emissions covered by the mechanism rose 5.6m tonnes, a 4% jump on the previous year. Some of the increase was from companies that lifted their emissions while staying within their limit.\n\nA spokesman for the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said all emitters met their obligations under the scheme last year.\n\nRising industrial pollution means national emissions have dipped only slightly, according to the most recent greenhouse accounts, despite reductions from electricity and drought-affected agriculture.\n\nThe data covers a period well before the coronavirus pandemic forced a significant economic shutdown. It is expected emissions will fall this year, though analysts have warned they are likely to return to previous levels once the threat from the virus has passed unless policies change.\n\nThe data shows the biggest emitters last year were LNG projects: Chevron\u2019s Gorgon development in the Pilbara, Woodside\u2019s North West Shelf project and Inpex\u2019s Ichthys development.\n\nIn addition to companies emitting at levels above previous baselines, the data shows a growing number of companies have been granted what is known as a multiyear monitoring period, under which emissions limits are no longer annual, but spread over a number of years. The number of facilities with these multiyear limits increased from 17 to 31.\n\nMcFadzean said it was effectively another way for companies to avoid paying for emitting too much in a given year. \u201cIn many cases they are not reducing their emissions in subsequent years, but instead are allowed to recalculate their baselines and pollute more,\u201d he said.\n\nThe safeguard mechanism sets a baseline for industrial facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes each year. When the scheme began, baselines were based on either a facility\u2019s highest emissions level over the previous five years or an independent forecast of future pollution.\n\nUnder changes introduced this year, all facilities are moving to limits based not on total emissions, but on emissions intensity \u2013 how much they emit per unit of production. It means that companies that lift production will be able to release more CO 2 without risking a penalty.\n\nIt could also allow a government to require companies to reduce emissions intensity over time to drive a shift to cleaner practice without affecting production levels. Labor indicated it would have done this, without releasing much detail, if it won last year\u2019s election.\n\nIn 2015, Hunt said the safeguard would be used to cut emissions by 200m tonnes over the decade to 2030, but the government later shelved that estimate. The policy was not included among policies that the government said would help it meet Australia\u2019s commitments under the Paris climate agreement.\n\nIn February, Taylor said the safeguard mechanism was \u201cdesigned to support growth while encouraging businesses to lower their emissions intensity\u201d.\n\nThe Carbon Market Institute, representing businesses focused on climate action, has called for the safeguard mechanism and emissions reduction fund to be reformed as part of a post-virus economic repair that also focuses on \u201cland and climate repair\u201d.\n\nThe institute\u2019s chief executive, John Connor, said the emissions reduction fund would need to be less dependent on taxpayer\u2019s money and increasingly driven by business, and baselines under the safeguard should be strengthened to cut pollution over time.", "label": 0}, "se35": {"text": "A Canadian mining giant has withdrawn plans for a massive C$20.6bn ($15.7bn) tar sands mine, days before the federal government was to decide on whether to approve the controversial project.\n\nTeck Resources\u2019 surprise decision to withdraw from open pit Frontier Mine project landed as a bombshell on Sunday night, prompting outrage from politicians in oil-rich Alberta and cheers from environmental groups.\n\nIn a letter from Teck\u2019s chief executive, Don Lindsay, to Canada\u2019s environment minister, the company said it was \u201cdisappointed to have arrived at this point\u201d.\n\nAt full capacity, Frontier would have produced 260,000 barrels of crude oil per day, making it one of the largest in Alberta\u2019s carbon-intensive oil sands.

But JBS refused to discuss how many of its cattle came from indirect suppliers and declined to make a spokesperson available for interview.\n\n\u201cJBS is committed to eradicating deforestation, ensuring sustainable livestock practices and improving the livelihoods of farmers in the Amazon region,\u201d the company said by email. \u201cWe have worked for more than a decade on the frontlines, driving meaningful, responsible change in the region. We urge those who share the common goal of ending deforestation to seek solutions rather than criticism. We will only meet this collective challenge and preserve this important biome through collaboration and action.\u201d\n\nBut the company has been making these promises for more than a decade. In 2009 a devastating report from Greenpeace led to JBS, Marfrig and Minerva (another Brazilian meat giant) signing a landmark cattle agreement with the environmental NGO. The meat companies promised not to buy from any direct suppliers involved in deforestation and to expand that commitment to include indirect suppliers within two years.\n\nThe same year federal prosecutors in Amazon states signed agreements with more than a dozen meat companies, including JBS, Marfrig and Minerva.\n\n\u201cIt was a watermark,\u201d said Greenpeace Brazil\u2019s senior forest campaigner Adriana Charoux.\n\nDeforestation fell afterwards, said Daniel Azeredo, a federal prosecutor who played a key role in the prosecutors\u2019 deal.\n\nBut he noted: \u201cIt talked about the direct suppliers, those that sell to slaughterhouse, not those who sell to another farm.\u201d A clause in the deal requiring companies to start monitoring indirect suppliers had no deadline, he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fires were three times more common in beef-producing zones than in the rest of the Amazon in 2019.

Following the fine, Greenpeace abandoned the cattle agreement. \u201cOur credibility would have been completely at risk if we continued with them,\u201d Charoux said.\n\nThe deal with prosecutors still stands, but Azeredo believes meat companies should be doing more. \u201cAll the companies working in the Amazon know that indirect suppliers is a serious problem,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about these issues, JBS points journalists to the independent audits performed by Norwegian company DNV.GL, the latest of which reported that no irregularities relating to deforestation in 7,140 Amazon cattle transactions were found during 2018. The same company audits Marfrig.\n\nBut the 2019 audit added a caveat, as it also did in 2018. \u201cRegarding indirect suppliers, JBS and the industry in general does not yet have in place a verification system in these cases,\u201d it said.\n\nCritics questioned an audit that failed to check out the entire supply chain. \u201cNobody is going to buy the animals if they don\u2019t know where they are from, or if they are healthy,\u201d said Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting and finance at the University of Sheffield. \u201cIf there is a trail, that makes the auditors\u2019 omission even more damning.\u201d\n\nDNV.GL has been doing audits for Marfrig since 2011 and for JBS since 2018. \u201cOur role is to assess adherence to the \u2018minimum criteria for transactions with cattle and beef products on an industrial scale in the amazon biome\u2019,\u201d a spokesperson said in an email, referring to the terms of the deal with Greenpeace signed in 2009 \u2013 but crucially, not the promise to start monitoring indirect suppliers within two years, by 2011.\n\nRevealed: fires three times more common in Amazon beef farming zones Read more\n\n\u201cIndirect suppliers\u2019 information was requested, however the companies do not have this information,\u201d DNV.GL said. \u201cIn both cases a non-conformity was raised.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the case of indirect suppliers, JBS has not yet been successful in implementing traceability processes,\u201d the audit\u2019s \u201cnon-conformity\u201d entry read.\n\nSince 2013, Marfrig has used a self-declaratory mechanism called a request form of information (RFI) in which the farm delivering the cattle is required to supply the name of its supplier, including tax number and the name of the farm.

Tesla is due to build its Model 3 and Y cars at the site from July 2021.\n\nGr\u00fcnheide residents are divided over the issue. The town, home in the 1920s to a Bakelite plastics factory, has repeatedly missed out on any big economic success in the decades since reunification.\n\nAt pro-Tesla demonstration, locals said they were proud that an industry promoting a low-carbon future wanted to make its home in Gr\u00fcnheide. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on the map for something positive and we might even get to test drive the cars,\u201d said Elke, a gardener. \u201cI also hope the factory\u2019s presence will improve the local bus service.\u201d\n\nSteffen Schorcht, the founder of a citizens\u2019 initiative against it, said people felt \u201cbulldozed\u201d into accepting the project before basic questions had been answered. \u201cOf course you always have to weigh up the economic interests with those of environmental protection,\u201d he told Die Zeit. \u201cIt\u2019s important to involve the locals in the discussion from an early stage, and that simply did not happen here.

There are also worries about unexploded ordnance. Bombs and other munition weighing a total of 85kg from the second world war have been found at the site and detonated.\n\nMusk has addressed the environmental concerns, stating that Tesla\u2019s water usage would be much lower on a daily basis than the \u201crare peak usage\u201d quoted to German authorities. For every tree the company fells, it has promised to plant three more. \u201cSounds like we need to clear up a few things!\u201d he said in one of many tweets about the plant.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A citizens\u2019 information office has been set up on behalf of Tesla to reassure concerned residents.

In that time, the group has shifted its focus from the past tactics of lobbying Westminster politicians to the creation and development of a grassroots base of activists.\n\nIn the last 18 months 150 new community action groups have been created by the movement, while supporters of the environmental charity have more than doubled from about 160,000 to more than 400,000.\n\nThe move to tap into and amplify community frustrations at the failure to do enough to tackle climate breakdown has coincided with the growth of the school strikes movement and the appearance of Extinction Rebellion.\n\n\u201cWe have got to use the politics on the ground rather than rely on centralised institutions and politicians to do it for us,\u201d he said.\n\nBennett \u2013 who will take over as head of the Wildlife Trust in April \u2013 believes the explosion of activism has been caused partly by the deep frustration of ordinary people that we are not making fast enough progress to tackle climate change, combined with growing evidence from scientists that the world has an ever decreasing amount of time to make change.\n\n\u201cThere is something that is unique about these issues,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cThe longer we take to achieve the change, the worse the prize of the outcome. It is quite different to, say, campaigning for the abolition of slavery \u2026 the prize you get is still the same, even if it takes 100 years to get there.\n\n\u201cBut campaigning for eight or nine billion people to live fairly within environmental limits, the longer you take to do it, the lower the quality of the prize you get.\u201d\n\nIn his tenure at Friends of the Earth, Bennett has focused on community-based action against fracking in the UK, activism that was rewarded last year when the government announced a moratorium on fracking.\n\nHe believes it is community activism that has pushed the government to act against fracking, and prompted the attention Boris Johnson\u2019s government is giving to environmental concerns. Last week Johnson brought forward the deadline for ending the sale of diesel, petrol and hybrid vehicles from 2040 to 2035.\n\n\u201cIt is primarily because of people on the streets that this is happening,\u201d said Bennett.

In particular, freshwater insects have been increasing by 11% each decade following action to clean up polluted rivers and lakes. However, this group represent only about 10% of insect species and do not pollinate crops.\n\nResearchers said insects remained critically understudied in many regions, with little or no data from South America, south Asia and Africa. Rapid destruction of wild habitats in these places for farming and urbanisation is likely to be significantly reducing insect populations, they said.\n\nInsects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, outweighing humanity by 17 times, and are essential to the ecosystems humanity depends upon. They pollinate plants, are food for other creatures and recycle nature\u2019s waste.\n\nThe previous largest assessment, based on 73 studies, led scientists to warn of \u201ccatastrophic consequences for the survival of mankind\u201d if insect losses were not halted. Its estimated rate of decline was more than double that in the new study. Other experts estimate 50% of insects have been lost in the last 50 years.\n\nRecent analyses from some locations have found collapses in insect abundance, such as 75% in Germany and 98% in Puerto Rico. The new, much broader study found a lower rate of losses. However, Roel van Klink, of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, who led the research, said: \u201cThis 24% is definitely something to be concerned about. It\u2019s a quarter less than when I was a kid. One thing people should always remember is that we really depend on insects for our food.\u201d\n\nThe research, published in the journal Science, also examined how the rate of loss was changing over time. \u201cEurope seems to be getting worse now \u2013 that is striking and shocking. But why that is, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said van Klink. In North America, the declines are flattening off, but at a low level.\n\nElsewhere, data is much more sparse. \u201cBut we know from our results that the expansion of cities is bad for insects because every place used to be more natural habitat \u2013 it is not rocket science,\u201d said van Klink. \u201cThis is happening in east Asia and Africa at a rapid rate. In South America, there is the destruction of the Amazon. There\u2019s absolutely no question this is bad for insects and all the other animals there. But we just don\u2019t have the data.\u201d\n\nVan Klink said the research showed that insects were faring only slightly better in nature reserves than outside protected areas. \u201cWe found that very striking and a bit shocking \u2013 it means something\u2019s going wrong there.\u201d\n\nLosses of insects are driven by habitat destruction, pesticides and light pollution. The impact of the climate crisis was not clear in the research, despite obvious local examples. Van Klink said changes in heat and rain could harm some species while boosting others, even in the same location.\n\nBut he highlighted another study showing that rising carbon dioxide levels are reducing the nutrients in plants and significantly cutting grasshopper abundances on prairies in Kansas, US. \u201dThat is absolutely shocking, because that could be happening all over the world.\u201d\n\nProf Dave Goulson, of the University of Sussex, who was not involved in the new analysis, said: \u201cPeople should be as concerned as ever about insects. It is great news that some aquatic insects seem to be increasing, probably from a very low level. But the bulk of insects are terrestrial and this new study confirms what was already clear: they have been declining for many decades.\u201d\n\nMatt Shardlow, the head of the conservation charity Buglife, said: \u201cMany insect species are threatened with extinction and this study shows insect abundance is also declining at an unsustainable rate. While the estimate in this study is lower than some, it is still very steep. Massive abundance declines in flying insects remains a developing ecological disaster.\n\nIn a comment article in Science, Maria Dornelas, of the University of St Andrews, and Gergana Daskalova, of the University of Edinburgh, said the new study was the largest and most complete meta-analysis to date. \u201cEmbracing nuance allows us to balance accurate reporting of worrying losses with hopeful examples of wins,\u201d they said.\n\nVan Klink said: \u201cWe definitely have a lot of reason for concern, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late. The increase in freshwater species makes us at least hopeful that if we put the right legislation in place, we can reverse these trends.\u201d", "label": 0}, "se50": {"text": "One in five children aged eight to 16 have nightmares about the state of the world.

Although Volkswagen has been found guilty in the US, in Europe the carmaker has denied that it cheated tests.\n\nThe preliminary finding in the case on Monday, by Mr Justice Waksman, casts a fresh light on the activities of the carmaker, first revealed in the \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal of 2015.\n\nIn his summary, the judge wrote: \u201c[After considering the arguments made by Volkswagen] the upshot was that I found that the software function in the vehicles here did indeed amount to a prohibited \u2018defeat device\u2019\u2026 I also concluded that VW\u2019s attempt to relitigate the issue here was an abuse of the process.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cA software function which enables a vehicle to pass the test because (artificially) it operates the vehicle in a way which is bound to pass the test and in which it does not operate on the road is a fundamental subversion of the test \u2026 it destroys the utility of the test.\u201d\n\nDiesel vehicles were once touted by the car industry as a green alternative to petrol vehicles because they have lower greenhouse gas emissions. But their emissions of tiny particles and irritant gases such as nitrogen dioxide are far higher, unless trapped by filters.\n\nIn 2015, campaigners revealed that cars produced by Volkswagen emitted far more nitrogen oxides in standard road driving than was recorded in test conditions.

Global costs are thought to have reached at least $21bn.\n\nGareth Pope, who leads the legal team at the Slater and Gordon law firm, representing 70,000 claimants, said: \u201cThis damning judgment confirms what our clients have known for a long time but Volkswagen has refused to accept: that Volkswagen fitted defeat devices into millions of vehicles in the UK in order to cheat emissions tests.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s conclusion that the existence of software was a \u2018fundamental subversion\u2019 of tests designed to limit pollution and make our air safe to breath exposes VW\u2019s disregard for EU emissions regulations and public health, in pursuit of profit and market dominance.\u201d", "label": 0}, "se56": {"text": "In the last years of the 20th century, Glenfeshie, a 17,000-hectare estate in the Scottish Highlands, was in steep decline. Decades of overgrazing by deer had reduced its hillsides to clipped lifelessness. Denied the protection afforded by tree roots, the banks of the River Feshie were losing soil each time it flooded, the water depositing silt downstream. Those few Scots pines that had survived the browsing of the deer were nearing the end of their lives; soon there would be no seed source for the next generation.\n\nThe end of farming? \u2013 podcast Read more\n\nBetween 1997 and 2006, ownership of Glenfeshie passed between three Danish businessmen \u2013 and with it a self-destructive business model. Only by maintaining very high numbers of livestock could the flow of fee-paying deerstalkers armed with rifles be ensured, but because of the rising cost of gamekeepers and estate upkeep, Glenfeshie\u2019s sporting operations were still making a loss. All the while, the pine martens, mountain hares and hen harriers for which the Highlands are a natural habitat were being crowded out by the deer on which the model depended.\n\nIn 2006, the billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, the last and richest of the three Danes, whose fashion empire includes the online retail giant Asos, bought Glenfeshie. Urged on by his man on the ground, a former land agent called Thomas MacDonell, he intensified efforts that had started under his predecessor to bring down deer numbers, with a view to allowing the estate\u2019s woodland to recover and biodiversity to return.\n\nGlenfeshie is the biggest of the 12 Scottish estates that Povlsen and his wife Anne began acquiring and rewilding in 1996 \u2013 in the process spending a total of \u00a370m and becoming the country\u2019s largest private landowners. Although the term \u201crewilding\u201d \u2013 meaning an approach to conservation that allows nature a free rein \u2013 has been in currency since 1990, many traditional landowners and gamekeepers continue to spurn both the term and the idea behind it. In the Highlands, rewilding implies that the concept of the country estate as a setting for people of quality to shoot game has had its time. Never very profitable \u2013 the Highlands were where rich people came to spend money they had made elsewhere \u2013 in recent decades, the sporting estates have become still less viable. As one veteran gamekeeper told me, very few of them actually make money.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anne and Anders Holch Povlsen, owners of Glenfeshie. Photograph: Tariq Mikkel Khan/AFP\n\nBy 2013, MacDonell and his team had culled 8,000 deer at Glenfeshie, and his local opponents, among them a neighbouring deerstalking enterprise, had camped on the moral high ground. \u201cWhen they shoot deer they call it sport,\u201d MacDonell said wryly when I visited him last September, \u201cand when we shoot deer they call it slaughter. Also, they claimed it would take hundreds of years for the woodland to regenerate.\u201d\n\nWe were standing on a track overlooking the River Feshie. On either side, young Scots pines displayed bright green needles against the glowing heather. Among the pines grew rowans hung with scarlet berries, and bilberry bushes whose leaves would be fair game for white moth caterpillars in spring. There were more new trees on the far side of the Feshie, binding the banks and spreading up the hillside. MacDonell smiled. \u201cAs you can see, our opponents were wrong.\u201d\n\nOver the past 20 years or so, from South America to the Danube basin, ad hoc coalitions of politicians, activists and conscience-stricken billionaires (whose core activities, such as Povlsen\u2019s clothing business, are often less than environmentally friendly), have rewilded millions of acres of mostly failed agricultural and grazing land. Their guiding philosophy \u2013 that we should leave the land alone \u2013 upends the long dominant view that land should be cleared, ploughed and wrung ever more efficiently for food.\n\nBecause many of the practitioners are billionaires, and because the landscapes they have returned to nature are (no matter who owns them on paper) our cherished inheritance, and because of a deeply held tradition of depending on the land for food, rewilding attracts controversy. But it is based on a longer view of the planet\u2019s health, which dictates that we use the land not only to feed ourselves in a more environmentally sustainable way, but also to capture greenhouse gases, save endangered species and offer ourselves an occasional break from traffic and hand-sanitisers \u2013 that is, to leave town and enjoy the works of nature.\n\nThe regeneration of Glenfeshie is such a work. Across the hills that divide the Feshie\u2019s catchment from that of the neighbouring river, the Tromie, MacDonell and his team have planted hundreds of thousands of pines, birches, willows and other native trees over the past decade. A few years from now, these stems will develop into a barrier against erosion, a carbon sink and a habitat for distinctive Highland birds such as the capercaillie and ptarmigan. Birds and the wind distribute seeds, while the estate\u2019s deer, whose concentration has been brought down from 40 per sq km to one, are no longer numerous enough to eat all the young shoots. The increased vegetation also provides food for the pine martens, red squirrels and mountain hares that MacDonell is seeing in rising numbers, while the population of endangered birds such as crossbills and crested tits has also risen.\n\nFor whose benefit? The Povlsens\u2019 Scottish operations currently make an annual loss of \u00a33m, but it is hoped that they will turn a profit by 2027, thanks to clients paying to stay in luxurious accommodation, enjoy exquisitely underdone venison and wander the restored landscapes. When rewilding plans were first revealed, critics of Scotland\u2019s concentrated land ownership \u2013 half of the Scottish countryside is owned by around 450 people \u2013 expressed fears that Glenfeshie might become a reservation for the rich, but these have been partially allayed by letting ordinary hikers walk across the glens for free.\n\nIf rewilding seems like a rich person\u2019s indulgence, this is because its economic viability is unproven. It is also a misnomer, for whether by getting rid of tens of thousands of sheep in Patagonia or introducing a living species as a surrogate for an extinct one \u2013 Sayaguesa cattle in place of aurochs in Croatia\u2019s Velebit Mountains, for instance \u2013 rewilding requires more human intervention than its name suggests. The tourism it offers is limited; a rewilded area cannot accommodate many people without undermining its own existence. By diverting investment towards repairing landscapes and contributing to the public weal, rewilders are taking money away from conventional economic activities. And this is where its impact will be felt in British farming. Barely a decade ago, the notion that land should be managed in order to ensure planetary wellbeing had few takers among farmers whose raison d\u2019etre was to fill human bellies at the lowest possible cost. But this is the proposition that is now poised to determine the future of farming.\n\nFarmers account for just 1.5% of the British population, but the size of their domain \u2013 71% of the country\u2019s surface area is classified as farmland \u2013 has given them power over the public imagination, reinforced by children\u2019s books depicting resourceful hens and humorous porkers. Over time, this image of Britain \u2013 green, giving and blossomy, an Eden to which city-dwellers joyfully flee in moments of leisure \u2013 came to inform the country\u2019s view of itself.\n\nMemories of resilience in adversity were inevitably a factor in the growth of intensive farming. When the country was blockaded during the second world war and the nation\u2019s farmers were told to convert scrub and pasture to sown fields, arable land doubled. In peacetime, the patriotic drive for self-sufficiency continued, as the population soared and farmers cleared more land in order to produce more food. Between 1946 and 1963, an average of 3,000 miles of hedgerows were stripped out each year.\n\nAfter Britain joined the European Community in 1973, its farmers received subsidies that rewarded production and \u2013 when that led to wasteful surpluses \u2013 simply for holding farmland. In 2017, some \u00a32.73bn was disbursed in this way. For decades, farmers justified their subsidies by citing the continuing need for British self-sufficiency in food production, despite the fact that in many cases they were only solvent thanks to European subsidies. During that time, there was still only minimal awareness that the relentless drive for higher yields through intensive methods might be bad for the environment. The few farmers who questioned the prevailing wisdom faced ostracism by their peers.\n\nSo Charles Burrell discovered in 2000, when he declared defeat after a decade and a half of intensive farming at Knepp, his 1,400-hectare estate in the south of England. Burrell had invested in automatic feeding systems, state-of-the-art combine harvesters and gallons of fertilisers and pesticides in order to coax more milk from his cows and higher yields from the stodgy Sussex clay. But for 13 of his 15 years in charge, Burrell sank more money into the farm than he received in revenues, and the estate was \u00a31.5m overdrawn. In February 2000, he told his employees that he was coming out of farming.\n\n\u201cThe farm workers \u2026 left the office grimly shaking their heads,\u201d his wife, Isabella Tree, recalled in Wilding, the book she wrote about the couple\u2019s experiences. But if liquidation was shocking, Burrell\u2019s decision to seek public money to turn his farm into a \u201cbiodiverse wilderness\u201d, and his aim to turn a profit through tourism and organic meat, seemed downright perverse.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Longhorn cattle at Knepp in West Sussex. Photograph: Picasa/PR\n\nIn 2001, starting with a small section of the estate and gradually expanding as funding became available, Burrell stopped ploughing the land and spraying it with chemicals. Removing internal fences allowed the wild Exmoor ponies and Tamworth pigs he introduced to browse and rootle over large distances, their disruptions creating habitats for other animals and plants. Dung beetles dived into delicious organic cowpats left by longhorn cattle that hadn\u2019t been fed wormers and parasiticides; voles colonised the roots of a dead oak that under the previous regime would have been felled in the interests of tidiness. The summer of 2002 revealed wildflowers with delightful names such as bird\u2019s-foot trefoil and lady\u2019s bedstraw that hadn\u2019t been seen in such numbers for a generation, along with a profusion of insects, which produced a continuous thrum \u2013 \u201csomething\u201d, in Tree\u2019s words, \u201cwe hadn\u2019t even known we\u2019d been missing\u201d.\n\nMuch bigger and more ambitious rewilding schemes than Knepp are currently underway across Europe. But whatever the challenges that face international conservationists who are restoring the largely abandoned Coa Valley of northern Portugal, or those at work in Swedish Lapland (population: 1,000), mass hostility from the locals isn\u2019t one of them. Rewilding in the densely populated Sussex Weald was a tougher sell.\n\nIn August 2003, Burrell invited local farmers to Knepp with the aim of converting them to the project. As he laid out his vision of fields and hedges devolving into scrub and wetland, his audience erupted with anger. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t simply that our neighbours (including some other members of the family) thought this wasn\u2019t right for them,\u201d Tree wrote. \u201cIt was more visceral \u2026 an affront to the efforts of every self-respecting farmer, an immoral waste of land, an assault on Britishness itself.\u201d\n\nBy 2008, Knepp was suffused by weeds such as ragwort, whose vivid yellow flowers are great for pollinators but can kill livestock in the rare event that they are eaten in large amounts. In a letter to the West Sussex County Times, a critic resorted to doggerel to denounce Knepp\u2019s \u201cragwort shame, spread like the plague, and who\u2019s to blame?\u201d\n\nWhen I visited Knepp after heavy rain last autumn, what had been arable fields were a sodden mishmash of young trees, billowing hedges and fleabane stalks, naturally occurring growths that have enhanced Knepp\u2019s capacity for carbon capture. In 2011, Burrell had deliberately collapsed the banks of the River Adur where it runs through his property in order to create the kind of accommodating plain that floods harmlessly after heavy rain.\n\nBurrell\u2019s flood-plain and the ramblers\u2019 paths that criss-cross the estate constitute what the government defines as \u201cpublic goods\u201d: services provided to society without material profit. They have helped quiet much of the local opposition to Knepp\u2019s rewilding. Meanwhile, wildlife tourism has turned Knepp into a successful business that employs more people than it did when it was a farm. Springtime overnighters snuggling down in a luxury treehouse after a soak in the open-air, wood-fired Swedish Hikki bathtub may hear nightingales serenading their consorts; they can take home organic Knepp chops to remember the free-running Tamworths by. Tree\u2019s book Wilding has sold so well that its author recently appeared on the BBC\u2019s Desert Island Discs, an indication of impending national treasure status.\n\nGet the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n\nBurrell is nowadays asked about his methods by farmers from around the country. But Knepp is not easy to emulate; its success lies partly in its rarity and its aristocratic charm \u2013 Burrell is a baronet who lives in a rinky-dink castle. Nor are the farmers who consult him necessarily converts to rewilding. As Burrell himself says: \u201cThese guys may not like it, but they don\u2019t know what the future holds and are being forced to engage.\u201d\n\nAt present, in addition to the EU subsidy they receive for holding agricultural land, farmers who provide public goods, such as fostering wildflowers and mitigating flood risk, can claim EU environmental subsidies. But take-up has been patchy; between 2014 and 2017, environmental disbursals fell from \u00a3489m to \u00a3399m, a reflection of what farmers call the government\u2019s overly prescriptive approach.\n\nThe brutal fact is that government policy is about to get a lot more prescriptive. With Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, the government is scrapping the subsidy system which has kept British farming in stasis for years \u2013 and on which the livelihoods of many thousands depend. Under the agriculture bill currently before parliament, subsidies will be redirected at public goods alone. If a farmer does not provide such services, they will have to live off sales of their produce. This may not be a problem for the UK\u2019s bigger farming companies, but impossible for many of the smaller family-owned enterprises whose annual subsidy is currently all that keeps them from insolvency.\n\nHence the queue of worried farmers outside Burrell\u2019s door. Knepp may hold the secret to rehabilitating the tarnished name of British farming. The more candid of the country\u2019s farmers admit that they have suffered a calamitous fall in public esteem. From being the devoted fillers of the nation\u2019s larders and the custodians of rural heritage, farmers, as one lamented to me, are increasingly seen as people who \u201ctake public money while raping the land\u201d.\n\nIntensive arable farming is designed to raise yields and eliminate pests and disease. The more fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides are used, the bigger the harvests. Back in the chemical-free, weed-infested 1940s, Charles Burrell\u2019s great-grandfather was lucky if he got two tonnes of wheat per hectare. Nowadays, farmers using high-yielding varieties would expect to harvest 10 tonnes of wheat per hectare, usually after applying pesticides, ammonium nitrate fertiliser, and a sprinkling of Roundup \u2013 a weedkiller found to have caused non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma among farmers. Overlooking their carcinogenic properties, the right chemicals \u2013 and the right weather \u2013 bring amazing results. In 2015, a farmer from Northumberland posted a yield of 16.52 tonnes per hectare, winning him a place in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nFor all the role that chemicals have played in improving yields, creating a loyal customer base among many of Britain\u2019s 17,000-odd farms, there is a growing appreciation of the long-term environmental damage they cause. With repeated application over several years, chemicals kill the tiny mycorrhizal fungi that supply roots with water and nutrients, as well as earthworms that provide aeration and improve drainage.\n\nOveruse of these chemicals, along with the mania for stripping out hedgerows and scrub that provide food and shelter for many animals, has led to a calamitous loss of wildlife. More than 40% of species in Britain have been declining since 1970, while one in every seven of its wildlife species faces extinction, a much worse record than the world average.\n\nThen there is the contribution that farming makes to climate change. British agriculture is responsible for 10% of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through methane from cows and sheep, nitrous oxides that are produced by fertilisers, and CO2 that comes off the land when carbon-rich organic matter in the soil oxidises during ploughing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sheep graze at Weston Park Farms in Hertfordshire. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nGuided by Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who advises the government on farming policy, the political establishment has become decidedly sceptical of the old benign image of British farming. Last year, Helm called for the \u201cfull scale of the disaster of British agriculture\u201d to be recognised, adding that \u201cno other economic activity combines such a perverse set of incentives, or produces so little value for its true costs\u201d.\n\nEven sheep-farming, celebrated by William Wordsworth as a symbol of rural plenitude, is nowadays described as an ecological disaster by writers and activists such as George Monbiot, who argues that the only hope for Britain\u2019s \u201csheep-wrecked\u201d hills is to reforest them and get rid of ruminants altogether.\n\nConverts to the new scepticism include Michael Gove, who, as environment secretary in Theresa May\u2019s government, had a big hand in drafting the agriculture bill currently being scrutinised by MPs. Even the National Farmers Union has committed its members to going carbon-neutral by 2040 \u2013 though that goal may only be attainable through as yet undeveloped carbon capture technologies.\n\nThe agriculture bill sits snugly alongside the government\u2019s environment bill, another Gove baby, which had its first parliamentary reading in January and will enshrine the so-called \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle, according to which dirty industries are penalised at source. No longer can farmers who use chemicals that run into rivers expect water companies and the fishing industry to pick up the bill. Instead, the use of chemicals will be priced according to the greenhouse gases that are emitted while making them and the cost of clearing up the mess they cause \u2013 though the vexed question of exactly how the costs will be spread has yet to be resolved.\n\nThe change that is coming over farming can be summarised in simple economic terms. Intensive agriculture prioritises a bumper harvest \u2013 the annual dividend \u2013 while the new approach emphasises the preservation of the initial capital \u2013 the land itself. For a glimpse of how this new investment priority will affect British farming, it suffices to visit those progressives who have already, to varying degrees, made it their own.\n\nOne afternoon last September, John and Paul Cherry invited me on to their Hertfordshire farm to show how to regenerate damaged soil. Until 10 years ago, each autumn the brothers would laboriously turn over lifeless slabs of clay, which needed to be pulverised with a power harrow before sowing could begin. Then they would douse the land with chemicals to coax forth an unwilling wheat crop. \u201cIt was as if we were in a battle with nature,\u201d Paul said.\n\nIn the 1990s, following innovators in the US midwest, a handful of British farmers went organic or stopped ploughing the soil to make a seed bed (so-called \u201cno-tillers\u201d). In 2010, the Cherrys followed suit, planting cover crops such as clover to reduce soil erosion and lock in carbon over the winter, and cutting their use of chemicals. \u201cThat brought us much closer to what nature would have us do,\u201d said John as he poured some crumbling, friable soil reverentially into my hand, pausing to point out some \u201clovely\u201d wormholes. \u201cIt\u2019s a miniature rainforest,\u201d he went on, \u201cwith more living things in it than there are people on the planet, full of bacteria and protozoa that are feasting off each other and interacting with the roots of the plant.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing about soil health from the Cherrys, I travelled north to the Fens, about 400,000 hectares of low-lying coastal plain in the east of England, which produces more than 7% of the country\u2019s agricultural produce on less than 4% of its agricultural land. This flat, largely treeless landscape, much of which was reclaimed from the sea in the 18th and 19th centuries and is now protected by a stupendous system of dykes, cuts, drains and washes, is home to a farmer named Tom Clarke.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A combine harvester in a field of barley near Salisbury, Wiltshire. Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty\n\nStanding on black, peaty ground in the shadow of Ely Cathedral, Clarke pointed out his neighbour\u2019s field, which had been ploughed and was bare up to the dyke that divides the two properties. Clarke\u2019s side, by contrast, featured a 10-metre margin of fodder radishes and wildflowers, a combination that provides pollen for bees and seeds for the grey partridges and corn buntings whose food sources have been depleted by intensive farming. When Clarke was a child, his father farmed the same land using intensive methods. Back then, almost the only wildlife to be seen was \u201cthousands of rabbits.\u201d\n\nFrom Ely, I drove south-east to a farm in Suffolk where Brian and Patrick Barker showed me how they are preparing for the introduction of the \u201cpolluter pays\u201d laws. One of the cousins\u2019 fields had been split into two strips, the first left bare after harvest, the second planted with phacelia, rye and radish. Over the winter, these \u201ccatch-crops\u201d are left in the ground, where they capture the residual potash and nitrates from last year\u2019s crop in their roots and stop them polluting nearby streams. At the end of the trial period, a comparison will be done between run-off from the two strips, and the catch-crops\u2019 efficacy will be measured. Under the government\u2019s new subsidy regime, environmentalism and economics will \u2013 in theory \u2013 perfectly align.\n\nThe Barkers have started bringing livestock on to their fields to provide natural fertiliser \u2013 a nod to the old practice of \u201cmixed\u201d farming, whereby farmers grew crops and kept livestock, which went out with intensive methods. Brian told me that he had listened to Isabella Tree\u2019s book Wilding twice while he was manoeuvring his combine harvester around the fields. He found it interesting, \u201cbut if everywhere was Knepp we\u2019d have a lot of wildlife and not a lot else\u201d.\n\nEvery British farmer I spoke to while researching this article has an opinion on what the Burrells have done at Knepp, even if it is to damn the enterprise as tokenistic and unproductive. Environmentally friendly regeneration still has formidable opponents, among them old-school intensive farmers and the agribusinesses that make seeds and chemicals, as well as some plant scientists. In their view, a single unpalatable truth trumps any number of bees and buntings \u2013 and that is the looming global dearth of food.\n\nIn 2009, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation warned that the global population would increase by 34% by 2050, to 9.1 billion. It added that \u201cin order to feed this larger, more urban and richer population, food production \u2026 must increase by 70%\u201d. In the light of the UN\u2019s predictions, advocates of business-as-usual argue that the redirection of farmland towards public goods will lead to a massive shortfall in production, and that the solution is to grow more food.\n\nFor Bill Clark, the technical director of the National Institute of Plant Botany (Niab), a research institute funded by some of Britain\u2019s biggest farming enterprises, this means increasing yields. Clark regards the dispute over whether soil should be productive or healthy as a distraction from the basic choice between being able to feed people or not. \u201cIf yields don\u2019t rise,\u201d he told me at Niab\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge, \u201cpeople in north Africa\u201d \u2013 a major export market for European farmers \u2013 \u201cwon\u2019t simply be unable to afford the wheat they need in order to live: there will be no wheat.\u201d\n\nTo Clark\u2019s dismay, precisely at the point when Britain and the rest of Europe need a productivity spurt in order to export more to the world, yields have plateaued, thanks to what Clark called the \u201cirrational dogma which says that technology is bad\u201d.\n\nClark is a believer in the power of science to improve the human lot. In his view we have become so blase about technological advance that we overlook the fact that science has saved countless people from starvation. He spoke with reverence of the revolution that highly fertile Japanese wheat wrought when it was crossed with European varieties in the 50s: \u201cThe plant halved in size but yields doubled.\u201d Visit one of Niab\u2019s walk-in growth chambers and you\u2019ll see the newest miracle: wheat developed by using a gene from oats that confers immunity to the root disease known as take-all. The new strain can be sown in successive years on the same field without falling foul of the disease (conventional practice dictates that the way to avoid take-all is to plant wheat in rotation with different crops, which naturally lowers aggregate wheat production).\n\nBut Niab\u2019s yield-enhancer cannot be marketed because of the EU\u2019s hostility to genetically modified (GM) crops \u2013 a hostility that extends to an increasing number of chemicals including neonicitonoid insecticides. As a result of an EU ban of neonicitonoids, rapeseed yields crashed . \u201cAnd if you were to take fungicides out of the equation,\u201d Clark told me, \u201cas campaigners are demanding, wheat yields would probably drop by 20-30%. Is that what people really want?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Cherry of Weston Park Farms inspects and smells the soil in one of his fields. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nIt is possible that there is one particular sector of farmers who will not be overly affected by the new agriculture bill. Where economies of size combine with naturally fertile soil that hasn\u2019t yet been destroyed by chemicals, intensive farming continues to be remunerative.\n\nMichael Sly\u2019s family has been farming around the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, since the civil war, buying and selling land until Park Farm \u2013 as the Sly establishment is called \u2013 reached its present size of 1,600 hectares. Whether it is the annual service of thanksgiving he organises at harvest festival, the thousands who visit Park Farm on \u201copen farm\u201d weekend in June, or his chairmanship of the local history society, Sly enjoys the status of \u2013 his words \u2013 \u201ca big commercial arable farmer\u201d. And while he is proud of the margins he has set aside for bees and birds, Sly\u2019s mission isn\u2019t environmental services. It\u2019s growing food.\n\nSly\u2019s professional vision is defined by his huge fields of sugar beet that stretch towards the horizon, his state-of-the-art tractors, seed drills and combine harvesters, each of which is worth \u201cmultiple tens of thousands of pounds\u201d, and his contracts to supply premium grade wheat for national brands such as Weetabix and Mini-Cheddars. He regards wilding as relevant only to \u201ca certain percentage of affluent society\u201d, and his shiny new 2,000-tonne store \u2013 which bulged with grains when I visited \u2013 is a hymn to the mass market.\n\nSly refuses to commit to techniques such as cover cropping or no-tillage that might reduce yields, and whose commercial viability is unproven. (For all the worms wriggling in their soils, the Cherry brothers\u2019 farming operation is loss-making, and will probably remain so until subsidy reforms kick in.) Sly\u2019s worry is that once Britain has left the EU, the government will remove tariffs on imported produce grown using neonicotinoids or GM, undercutting British farmers. (Britain already imports half its food. When UK oilseed rape yields plummeted following the neonicotinoid insecticide ban, the shortfall was made up by importing Canadian rapeseed oil that had been produced using the same insecticides.)\n\nIncreased imports would endorse Sly\u2019s deeper apprehension that the government is preparing to surrender entirely to the current \u201cevangelism\u201d for public goods that don\u2019t fill bellies. With the country in the process of exiting the EU, which currently supplies 30% of the country\u2019s agricultural needs, Sly does not hide his exasperation at the scant attention being paid to food security, the proud and \u2013 at present \u2013 impossible idea of the country feeding itself if there is a global shortage of food. \u201cIf Britain wants to carry on producing certain foods,\u201d he said, \u201cthe system that is being proposed won\u2019t be compatible with that goal. You have to ask yourself whether you want low-input, low-output farmers or high-input, high-output farmers. There\u2019s no in-between.\u201d\n\nThe obvious way to mitigate the shortages of food that the UN anticipates is to throw less away. After decades of plenty in some parts of the world, about one-third of the food that is produced each year, or about 1.3bn tonnes, goes to waste. The proportion of the budget of the average British household that goes on food has come down from more than 30% in the 60s to below 10% today. (After Singapore and the US, Britain has the cheapest food \u201cbasket\u201d of any country.) It is little wonder that a commodity that people buy so casually, and with such little regard for the natural resources and human ingenuity that have gone into its production, should be discarded in such quantities.\n\nIf there is no discernible panic among your fellow shoppers in the supermarket, this is because the prospect of shortages seems so remote from today\u2019s glut. Isabella Tree contrasts the calls of \u201cretailers, agribusiness and farmers\u2019 unions\u201d for the production of more food with \u201cthe experiences of farmers like ourselves, driven out of business by \u2026 low commodity prices resulting from subsidies and over-production\u201d. Governments of neither left or right dare contemplate measures, such as imposing VAT on food, that would encourage thrift.\n\nWhile the debate continues over the use of advanced genetic and chemical crop-enhancers, technology is opening a whole new direction for food production, which will take farming away from the farm. Robotics and drones are reducing the need for humans to be on the land, while vertical farming, in which vegetables can be grown in sunless warehouses using LED lighting, gene editing and metagenics \u2013 the engineering of specific enzymes or proteins \u2013 are coming up with new definitions of food. According to a recent report by the thinktank RethinkX, within 15 years the rise of cell-based meat, which is made of animal cells grown in a bioreactor, will bankrupt the US\u2019s huge beef industry, at the same time removing the need to grow soya and maize for feed. By 2035, the report predicts, an area a quarter of the size of the continental US \u201cwill be freed for other uses\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Discarded vegetables in Burscough, Lancashire.

Already, as parliament has heard, a lot of British hill farmers are not being replaced when they retire. As a child in London, I heard my mother\u2019s stories of growing up as the daughter of farmers on the Canadian Prairies. There was no Roundup weedkiller, though I\u2019m sure my mother and her siblings, bent double to pick weeds from a field of mustard, would have appreciated it. For my own children, urbanites to their bones, their grandmother\u2019s upbringing must be hard to conceive. Farming is retreating even from the imaginative capacity of most Britons.\n\nThat many farmers confess to being confused and worried about their future is hardly surprising. The new measures will have a seven-year phasing-in period, at the end of which some of the small farmers who have been unable to adapt will go bust. What is to stop their land being swallowed up by big intensive farmers who don\u2019t rely on subsidies? Others, rather than manoeuvre themselves through the hoops erected by public goods, may decide to turn their land over to enterprises less favourable to dormice and goldfinches: go-karting, motorbike scrambling or parcel distribution.\n\nA sentiment I heard repeatedly runs like this: farmers will do whatever society wants them to do, but the sums (ie, the subsidies, or market forces) have to be right.\n\nField of dreams: heartbreak and heroics at the World Ploughing Championships Read more\n\nEven if the claims contained in the RethinkX report are overblown, a transformation of the kind it outlines seems not only possible but desirable. When I met him last autumn in a converted warehouse, now a restaurant, in London\u2019s Kings Cross, Tony Juniper, the government\u2019s chief adviser on the natural environment and a former head of Friends of the Earth, described a future in which the cost of LED bulbs is more significant to farmers than a late frost, and Londoners think nothing of weekending among lynxes and beavers in a rewilded green belt.\n\nBritain\u2019s farming community is a tiny minority whose public influence is in terminal decline, and is destined to shrink further as technology requires fewer and fewer people to muddy themselves for a living. \u201cThe killer irony\u201d of the revolution in farming, said Juniper, in a building that used to receive sack upon sack of golden English wheat, \u201cis that farmers may not be around to see it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "label": 0}, "se57": {"text": "Amid the misery and chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic, there are some short-term consolations. The precipitous drop in road and air traffic has left the air cleaner and the skies clearer. For advocates of a Green New Deal (GND) \u2013 a vast, state-funded green infrastructure project, including a total transition to renewable energy and the construction of mass transit systems \u2013 there are reasons to be optimistic. As the severity of the unfolding global recession becomes clear \u2013 the IMF predicts a 3% global contraction \u2013 the GND looks like the best route to recovery.\n\nCould Microsoft\u2019s climate crisis \u2018moonshot\u2019 plan really work? Read more\n\nThe GND had been growing in popularity before the outbreak \u2013 including among establishment politicians, with all the leading Democratic presidential candidates expressing support for some form of it. But with 26 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the past five weeks alone, and given that green industries are more efficient job creators than fossil-fuel ones, there is a powerful, immediate economic rationale for some kind of \u201cgreen stimulus\u201d. That is without even taking into account the longer-term economic case for decarbonizing: a 2018 US climate report calculated that the devastating effects of unchecked global warming will shrink the US economy by as much as 10% by the end of this century.\n\nBut the economic fallout of Covid-19 has cast a harsher light on another strand of the climate movement, commonly termed \u201cdegrowth\u201d. Influential among Extinction Rebellion activists, but often regarded as unrealistic by mainstream policymakers, degrowthers, as their name suggests, argue that uncontrolled economic growth is ecologically unsustainable and that to avert climate catastrophe we need to not only shut down the fossil-fuel industries but to reduce consumption overall. Degrowthers insist that we must find ways of living and working that do not require our economies to endlessly expand.\n\nDegrowthers have been particularly susceptible to caricature in recent weeks. \u201cThe coronavirus crisis reveals the misery of degrowth,\u201d the Spectator predictably argued. But current living conditions \u2013 sudden mass joblessness, confinement and isolation, widespread food and income insecurity \u2013 are not a meaningful foretaste of greener things to come. The nightmare we are currently enduring is not degrowth\u2019s secret dream come true; it is at most a grotesque parody of it, and one which is now liable to be weaponized by opponents of the movement.\n\nReading the current moment as a repudiation of degrowth is premature and unjustified. It overlooks the distinction between what we are experiencing now \u2013 an unplanned, abrupt cessation of vast swaths of economic and social activity \u2013 and what advocates of degrowth envisage: a thoughtful, democratic, managed and equitable downsizing of the economy.\n\nMost degrowth advocates do not champion economic contraction as such, but argue for the necessity of adapting to the continuing, long-term global stagnation sometimes called \u201csecular stagnation\u201d. The fact that we can only think of slowing down our economies in terms of recession and austerity \u2013 with the associated cuts to public spending, growth in inequality and decline in real earnings \u2013 says much more about our political landscape than the economic facts.\n\nYet there is one important criticism of degrowth that has been decisively bolstered by the sharp reversal in global economic fortunes resulting from the coronavirus lockdowns: the consequences for jobs. GDP is a notoriously crude and partial measure of a society\u2019s wellbeing, failing to account for a whole host of indicative factors including equality, access to energy, the quality of healthcare, education and social support systems. But when GDP falls or slows because workers cannot produce goods or offer services, unemployment surges. Coronavirus has brought that reality dramatically home.\n\nAs the economist and energy adviser Robert Pollin has written: \u201cthe immediate effect of any global GDP contraction would be huge job losses and declining living standards for working people and the poor. During the Great Recession, global unemployment rose by over 30 million. I have not seen a convincing argument from a degrowth advocate as to how we could avoid a severe rise in mass unemployment if GDP were to fall by twice as much.\u201d\n\nThe twin crises besetting us \u2013 the public health emergency and the unfolding economic trauma triggered by the measures to contain it \u2013 have laid bare much about the configuration of our world that we already knew but rarely fully apprehend: its interconnectedness, its fragility, its stark inequalities. But these crises have also brought into visceral relief the fact that employment is the heart and soul of the economy. As the British economist James Meadway has argued, the economic depression now upon us threatens \u201cthe most fundamental institution of all in capitalism: the labor market itself\u201d.\n\nSince we have so little time left in which to stabilize the climate, we must be ruthlessly pragmatic in assessing the limitations of green strategies. Degrowth is no exception. The scale and speed of investment required to completely renovate the energy and transportation sectors does not seem conceivable without growth continuing, at least for the time being. Politically, as long as a steadily rising GDP remains an electoral necessity, it is difficult to imagine a recovery that doesn\u2019t involve desperate efforts to restore growth \u2013 and not necessarily through greener means \u2013 by politicians anxious to revive flagging ratings.\n\nYet to fixate on the question of growth risks exaggerating the differences between the Green New Dealers and degrowthers \u2013 elevating the former as practical-minded technocratic capitalists who want a return to normal economic activity, just motored by a different energy source, and dismissing the latter as abstemious, back-to-the-land utopians who want to deprive us of most of the luxuries of modern capitalist life.\n\nThis in turn could lead to our learning only some of the lessons of the current predicament, and taking only some of the opportunities it offers. What both strands of climate thinking ask us to consider \u2013 and what the current crisis poses with special, brutal force, as phrases like \u201ckey workers\u201d and \u201cessential services\u201d enter common parlance \u2013 is the question of what kinds of jobs we need, and what kinds our planet needs of us.\n\nWhich goods and services are indispensable, and which would we be better off without? Degrowth and the GND offer different answers to this question \u2013 from green infrastructure construction to the care economy \u2013 but they both pose it, as well as raising important broader questions about how, how much and why we work. Once it is safe to emerge from economic survival mode, I hope we will have the wisdom to follow the lead of both movements by systematically reflecting on which kinds of productive activity actually enrich our lives \u2013 and which among these our planet can sustain.", "label": 0}, "se58": {"text": "Sc\u2019ianew First Nation says climate activist group entered their lands without permission: \u2018You have insulted our community\u2019\n\nThis article is more than 1 month old\n\nThis article is more than 1 month old\n\nA First Nation in Canada has demanded climate activists at Extinction Rebellion apologize for trespassing on Indigenous territory during a protest last month, calling the group\u2019s actions \u201cdisturbing\u201d and in violation of traditional protocol.\n\nWhile Extinction Rebellion has often drawn criticism for its disruptive protests, the letter marks a rare public rebuke of the group from Indigenous leadership.\n\n'Revolution is alive': Canada protests spawn climate and Indigenous rights movement Read more\n\nOn 18 February, amid nationwide unrest over a contentious pipeline project, members of Extinction Rebellion arrived at the house of British Columbia premier to execute a citizen\u2019s arrest \u2013 a move police called a \u201ca gross invasion\u201d of privacy.\n\nPremier John Horgan wasn\u2019t at home when protestors arrived, but his wife Ellie Horgan was.

How are we to live in such a world?\n\nFor many people this process became suddenly tangible last summer when fires devastated south-eastern Australia. Over weeks and months we watched helplessly as the conflagration consumed lives, livelihoods, even entire ecosystems, while images that seemed wrenched from a dystopian future flickered across our screens. In the months since, those images have been superseded by the spreading catastrophe of coronavirus, a moment of discontinuity that has only reinforced the vulnerability of our society, the speed with which natural forces can overwhelm the structures that sustain and shape our world.\n\nPart of the job of any art is what the cultural theorist Donna Haraway calls staying with the trouble. Art exists to record how it feels to be alive here, now, to capture the confusing, conflicting, sometimes terrifying, sometimes joyous messiness of the moment. It exists to bear witness. But art also needs to do more than just capture the here and now. We need it to help us see beyond the immediate, to understand how our stories connect to those of other people, in other times, to help us recognise we are part of a larger story.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An old chair sticks out of the mud on the shore line of Lake Eucumbene at Old Adaminaby in 2007, a town that was flooded as part of the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme in 1956. Photograph: Mark Nolan/Getty Images\n\nA desire to give shape to some of these connections drove my 2015 novel, Clade, which traced the experiences of three generations of a family as their world was transformed by climate catastrophe. When I was writing Clade it still seemed possible we might avoid the worst effects of global heating. But in the years since finishing it that hope has become harder and harder to sustain. Every day brings new stories of loss and extinction, every day our world seems to grow more violent, more deranged. Every day the spectre of collapse seems closer at hand.\n\nFaced with this reality I began to ask a series of slightly different questions, questions about inevitability and the new reality we inhabit. At what point, I wondered, does what we are losing become unbearable? At what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world?\n\nEnvironmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present\n\nMy new novel, Ghost Species, seeks to explore these questions by asking what it would mean if the deep past were to come to life in a literal sense, through a scheme to recreate a Neanderthal child from remnant DNA. Although this idea might seem pure science fiction, it isn\u2019t, or isn\u2019t quite. Many scientists believe cloning may offer a way to de-extinct species wiped out by human activity. Here in Australia researchers have already laid many of the building blocks to resurrect the thylacine, while in Russia scientists in Siberia are working on a scheme to hold back the collapse of the permafrost by recreating the ecology that existed in the region 12,000 years ago, complete with woolly mammoths.\n\nIt seemed to me this technology and its possibilities offered a way of thinking through not just the idea that the world might have become unhinged, that time might be out of joint, but also the processes of grief and mourning so many of us are grappling with. What is it we are losing when a species or an ecosystem vanishes from the world? What it is we think we are bringing back if we recreate them? What would it be like to be such a being?\n\nAs the story and characters took shape, I found myself asking other questions. Questions about the super-rich and their planning for the end of the world. Questions about love and loss and the bond between the child and her adoptive mother. Questions about the boundary between human and the non-human.\n\nJob losses, cancelled tours, delayed releases: the Australian books industry grapples with 'huge shock' Read more\n\nAlong the way I began to write differently as well. Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present and the distant to our doorstep. Approaching them in fiction brought the boundary between fiction and real life crashing down as well, until finally it seemed I was processing my own fears and feelings directly into fiction, resulting in a book that was often frighteningly personal.\n\nYet most of all, I found myself having to confront a series of questions about the fragility of the structures that shape our world, the onrushing cost of climate catastrophe, and how we are to live in a world in which our most basic assumptions are collapsing.\n\nI began writing Ghost Species just after my father\u2019s death. It will be published a few weeks after my mother\u2019s. It was edited while bushfires raged up and down Australia\u2019s east coast, in a city thick with smoke and grief, and will be published in a world paralysed by a pandemic. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, it is a book that is, in many ways, defined and suffused by the sense of loss so many of us feel at the moment. But it is also a book that seeks to remind us that even out of the most seismic loss and grief, new configurations are always possible.\n\n\u2022 Ghost Species by James Bradley is out on 28 April 2020 through Hamish Hamilton", "label": 0}, "se60": {"text": "Neal Maxwell wants trade to go from 50,000 tonnes of plastic waste each year to zero by 2040\n\nA builder from Merseyside has launched a project that aims to remove plastic from the British construction industry within two decades.\n\nNeal Maxwell, who has worked in the trade for more than 30 years, co-founded the non-profit organisation Changing Streams after a trip to the Arctic.\n\nAppalled by the levels of plastic pollutants in the Arctic Ocean and the often-lethal impact on animals in the polar region, Maxwell and researchers from the University of Liverpool have drawn up a programme that they say could make construction plastic-free by 2040.\n\nThe sector is the second largest producer of plastic waste in the UK, after packaging.

The fourth was more mysterious, and I set out on a journey to try to understand it.\n\nIn my teenage years, I had developed an aptitude for drinking, as many adolescents do. But it was while working as a music journalist in my 20s that my addictions accelerated. By April 2012, at the age of 27, I was on my knees. I knew that the drink and drugs had to go: the highs were getting harder to achieve; the lows were becoming more dangerous, more self-destructive. I knew my mental and physical health were deteriorating, but I couldn\u2019t seem to stop or cut down. After months of trying to do this alone, I found a rehabilitation programme and set out on a path to sobriety.\n\nI had time on my hands, weekends loomed large and I needed to keep busy. So I started walking, wandering daily on Walthamstow Marshes in north-east London to watch the kestrels, caterpillars and the shaggy old heron. It made me feel safe and secure. Gradually, I realised that my mind needed these walks and I grew to rely on them. The natural world had become a kind of rehab: it soothed my rawness and patched me back together.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An autumnal scene at the Walthamstow Wetlands in north-east London. Photograph: Ray Wise/Getty Images\n\nIn those very early sober months, when I was learning to live without the crutches I had used for years, I felt as if I was walking around without skin. The critical inner voices that had contributed to my periods of mental illness had folded me into myself. But on the marshes, I started to look up and outwards. Even though I was usually alone when I walked, I never felt lonely. I was realising that I belonged to a wider family of species, the matrix of life, from the spiders to the lichen and the cormorants to the coots. Nature picked me up by the scruff of my neck, and I rested in her care for a while.\n\nWith the kind of urgent desire I had once had for mind-altering substances and music, I was now drawn to trees, birds, flowers and plants . I understood that time in nature softened the voices in my head and stabilised my mood, but I didn\u2019t, at the beginning, understand what was happening to my body, brain and mind. I hadn\u2019t realised that the essence of nature \u2013 the geometry, the scents, the sounds, the colours, the textures, the chemical makeup \u2013 could have such a life-changing power but, quite quickly, this became apparent.\n\nI began to plant things to watch them grow. One of the first things I noticed was that after gardening, digging my hands deep into the soil, I felt happy, upbeat, less stressed and generally more positive. Reading up on this, I saw that there may be a biological reason for it. One of the species of bacteria found in soil, M vaccae, has been found to affect the brain and increase stress resilience. In 2004, lung cancer patients at the Royal Marsden hospital in Surrey who were given an immunisation containing the bacteria reported feeling happier. As Dr Christopher Lowry, one of the leading neuroscientists in the field, said at the time: \u201cThese studies leave us wondering if we should all spend more time playing in the dirt.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Contact with bacteria in soil has been found to increase resilience to stress. Photograph: Cultura/Charles Gullung/Getty Images/Cultura RF\n\nOur microbiota are healthiest when they are diverse \u2013 and a diverse microbiota is influenced positively by an environment filled with organisms, which are found more abundantly outside. We are woven into the land, and wider ecosystems, more than we realise. Crucially, these old friends that we evolved with are able to treat or block chronic inflammation, which can also affect the brain and have a direct impact on mood. Studies have shown that spending just two hours in a forest can significantly lower levels of cytokines \u2013 an inflammation biomarker \u2013 in the blood, which could be caused by exposure to important organisms.\n\nIt is all very well thinking about how more connection with the natural world would make people happier and healthier. But it is all the more pressing given the situation we find ourselves in. How can forest bathing be prescribed when forests are threatened and diminishing across the world? How can people spend more time in green spaces when many of our parks are in decline?\n\nAs I fell in love with the trees and the soil, I began to see how endangered much of nature had become, and how these opportunities to commune with other species were slipping through our fingers. Alongside our disconnection from nature is, of course, the fact that the natural world is rapidly vanishing; our time on this Earth is haunted by habitat destruction, species loss and climate breakdown. While revelling in the glory of the rest of nature, I also fell into a state of ecological grief, the name for the psychological response to the nature and climate emergency; a mourning for the communities, wildlife and landscapes that are disappearing and a fear of what is to come. Of course, people in many countries \u2013 including Britain\u2019s flooded areas \u2013 are already suffering directly from the impact of the climate emergency. Others are experiencing anxiety, worry and dread about an anticipated future of ecological loss.\n\nThe more I learned about the benefits a connection to nature can have on our minds, the more it seemed appalling that access to nature is so threatened in some places. The destruction of ancient woodlands across the country; the felling of much-loved street trees in Sheffield and other urban areas; children barely given opportunities to play in woods, fields and parks; the legislation that is failing to protect our rivers, streams and wild places; and the fact that the UK will miss almost all its biodiversity targets that were set a decade ago.\n\nSpending time in restorative natural environments is dependent, partly, on weather, which is in flux. A study of antidepressants by the environmental psychologist Terry Hartig has suggested that colder summers may constrain restorative activities that reduce stress and depressive symptoms. Rates of SSRI prescriptions increased for men and women in an unseasonably cooler July in Sweden. At the other extreme, emerging evidence links potentially dangerous high temperatures to increased mental health problems, illness and suicide.\n\nFor those on the frontline of the climate crisis, the mental health impacts of ecological loss are already severe. In Kulusuk, Greenland, where the ice has melted, rates of depression, suicide and alcoholism have risen. In the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada, residents report feeling stressed, depressed and anxious because of the melted ice and changing weather patterns. It strikes at the very heart of identity. Farmers in the Australian wheat belt, whose farms have blown away in dust storms, have compared losing their farms to a death.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Diversity and richness of birdsong is linked to decreased stress and a quicker recovery of a balanced nervous system. Photograph: Fireglo2/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAs Glenn Albrecht, the Australian academic who coined the term \u201csolastalgia\u201d, to describe the distress caused by environmental change, points out, what is disordered isn\u2019t ecological grief, eco-anxiety or global dread but \u201cthe world that is causing you to feel that way\u201d. It is a natural response to loss \u2013 and it is likely to become more common.\n\nOur relationship with nature, even if it could be restored, isn\u2019t quite as simple as a soothing, serene ramble in the wild. The wild barely exists. So what is the effect of biodiversity loss on our minds, our inner selves, and the collective psyche?\n\nWhen we walk in the woods, or by a lake, or spend time in a garden or park, evidence suggests that our parasympathetic nervous system is more likely to be activated. This is responsible for the \u201crest and digest\u201d processes at work inside your body, associated with feelings of contentment, sleep and safety. The sympathetic nervous system\u2019s main function is to stimulate the body\u2019s reaction to stress, and ignore any non-essential business, such as immune function. Ideally, we want a balanced nervous system.\n\nAfter exposure to nature, our stress-recovery response is faster and more complete when compared with exposure to built environments. This has important consequences for our health at a time when stress-related diseases are on the increase. It also suggests that if we, as a society, are allowing trees to be cut down, or natural spaces in urban areas to be paved over, we are acting in a way that is damaging to public health. We need nature in order to recover from the stresses of life.\n\nResearch shows that green space seems to have a buffering effect on the stresses of an urban area\n\nThere are many studies that link natural sounds \u2013 particularly diversity and richness of bird song \u2013 to decreased stress and a quicker recovery of a balanced nervous system. Even people under anaesthetic have been found to produce fewer chemical biomarkers associated with stress \u2013 such as amylase in saliva \u2013 when played a recording of soft wind or birdsong.\n\nA few years into my research, I had a baby and moved to a town in Hampshire. Near my new home, I found a beautiful, wild cemetery containing ancient ruins, where a majestic beech tree shines batter-yellow in the autumn sun. Rabbits flicker in the long grass, occasionally stopping long enough so I can see the black inkwells of their eyes; goblets of ancient epiphytes decorate the brick walls. When I look closer at the yellow blotches of lichen with my pocket microscope, I see tiny cities made of gold, with depth and dimension and cherry-red microscopic bugs invisible to the naked eye.\n\nThe science of awe was first considered by a psychologist called Dacher Keltner at the University of California at Berkeley in a landmark paper published in 2003. Many experiences of awe in the modern world still come from an encounter with nature, despite our disconnection from it. Keltner found that awe increases happiness and lowers stress, perhaps unsurprisingly, but he also discovered just how powerful an experience of awe can be to the body and mind. The lab found that people were more ethical, kind and generous after feeling awe. Why? Perhaps from simply being in a good mood. But using functional MRI to look at the brains of participants, scientists saw that awe reduced activity in the default mode network, the area of the brain associated with a sense of self. It reminded me of a phenomenon I had heard about from recovering addicts: \u201caddiction.fm\u201d or the \u201cwashing-machine head\u201d. In other words, the self-centred, negative ruminations that a substance can hush temporarily but, in the long run, will only feed. I visited the cemetery with renewed vim, searching for moments of awe and finding them everywhere.\n\nAround that time, I got postnatal depression and there was a frightening period when nature didn\u2019t touch the sides. I felt nothing in the wild spaces that had previously brought me wonder and succour. But after medical help, I found that taking a walk through the cemetery instead of down a busy, polluted road, made me feel noticeably calmer and lighter. I was drawn to the effulgent green moss, the old, sprawling yews, the buzz of spotting a nuthatch or goldcrest or sparrowhawk.\n\nIt turns out that these walks may have been affecting my brain in immediate and significant ways. Researchers in Edinburgh asked a group of people to walk from a busy urban space to a public park, or vice versa. Both groups started with a high stress response. What was interesting was how green space seemed to have a buffering effect on the stresses of the urban area. Those who started in green space and walked into a busy built-up space experienced an increase in alpha brainwaves \u2013 the electrical activity of the brain associated with relaxation. Nature seemed to undo the stress of the city, in the moment.\n\nWhen I started on this journey, I might have said that a relationship or connection with the rest of nature isn\u2019t for everyone; that some people just don\u2019t like the outdoors. But, in fact, research shows that background nature is essential across the population for good mental health. Without access to natural landscapes, rich in biodiversity, our potential for restoration, peace and psychological nourishment is sorely degraded.\n\nIf we feel it, we can be galvanised by our ecological grief. We need a new relationship with the Earth, one that positions us not as conquerors, but co-tenants with wildlife and rivers and mountains and trees, respecting and caring for natural spaces because it is the right thing to do \u2013 and because we need the rest of nature for our lives and for our sanity.\n\nLosing Eden: Why Our Minds Need The Wild by Lucy Jones is published by Allen Lane on 27 February", "label": 0}, "se62": {"text": "Billingshurst, West Sussex: These butterflies catch the light beautifully, and for a few moments it seems a broken fragment of the sun is sparkling over the grass\n\nThe warm yellow sun is sinking between the rooftops.

When I was a child in the 1950s, lofty English elms, U procera, home to a cacophonous rookery, cast shade over the barns on the farm in Sussex where my grandmother worked. In the 1970s, when we lived in Warwickshire, rows of giant elms were the guardians of field boundaries, as quintessentially English as a Constable painting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018A starburst of crimson stamens\u2019: a single wych elm inflorescence. Photograph: Phil Gates\n\nAnd then, in little over a decade, they were nearly all gone, laid low by a virulent strain of the fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, Dutch elm disease, originating in Asia but characterised by mycologists in the Netherlands. The pandemic was transmitted via elm bark beetles but was carried across continents by the timber trade, attacking almost every Ulmus species in its path. Laid low, because it didn\u2019t kill the trees outright. Trunks died but roots survived, sprouting suckers that succumbed again when their girth was sufficient to attract bark beetles.\n\nSuckering makes elms easy to propagate quickly from cuttings, a tendency exploited by the Romans for raising saplings that supported their vines. Genetic research in Spain in 2004 demonstrated that when the legions invaded Britain, and vineyards were established, they introduced U procera to the English flora, importing a single seed-sterile Iberian clone. Two millennia later, it proved uniformly vulnerable to the devastating fungal pathogen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A tree sparrow, feeding in the canopy of a wych elm.

One swarm recently reported in Kenya covered an area the size of Luxembourg.\n\nThe organisation has requested $140m (\u00a3120m) to help fight the ongoing breeding of the insects, predicting that a continuation through late March and April could see the existing number of locusts grow by 400 times by June.\n\nThe current crisis is considered the worst in decades, and there are fears it could last longer than previous locust outbreaks.\n\nAlongside the climate emergency impact, the war in Yemen is a key factor.\n\nCressman said Yemen is a \u201cfrontline\u201d country for locusts, with the insects typically present throughout the year. But its once effective locust programme no longer has the same impact in cities where control is now divided between the government and Houthi rebels.\n\nThe head of the locust programme, Adel al-Shaibani, is based in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sana\u2019a.\n\n\u201cBefore the war we had a good ability to reach anywhere in Yemen,\u201d he said. \u201cIn current times we\u2019re just able to cover the Red Sea coastal areas \u2013 but not all \u2013 and some areas in the interior.\u201d\n\nHe explained that there were two separate locust control centres in Yemen but neither was able to combat the outbreak effectively alone.\n\nThe Sana\u2019a-based centre carried out control operations wherever they could in 2018, but they have been underfunded and have lost some of their vehicles.\n\n\u201cIn spite of all our hard efforts, some areas remained out of control due to security reasons near the border with Saudi Arabia. The desert locust outbreak occurred and some swarms formed and moved to other areas,\u201d said Shaibani.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A young desert locust without wings is seen on a stalk near Geerisa town, in Somaliland\u2019s Lughaya district. Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPA\n\nBy late 2019, the locusts had moved into the Horn of Africa, finding favourable conditions when an unseasonaal cyclone hit Somalia in December. This extended breeding time and allowed them to spread to areas authorities could not control because of the country\u2019s security problems.\n\n\u201cThis crisis could be quite long because of the Yemeni and Somali areas that cannot control the populations,\u201d said Cyril Piou, an expert with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development.\n\nHe said that in previous decades locust outbreaks had only lasted roughly two years but, without preventive systems, they will last longer, happen more frequently and spread further.\n\n\u201cWe are all linked in some way, what is happening somewhere else affects us all,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists turn to tech to prevent second wave of locusts in east Africa Read more\n\nThe last comparable locust outbreak was in the late 1940s and 50s, but Cressman said that was in a time when monitoring and reporting was a slow, cumbersome process and chemical pesticides were readily available for control operations.\n\nHistorically, the Arabian Gulf has very few cyclones. But the past decade has brought a significant increase thanks to the Indian Ocean dipole, a phenomenon linked to flooding in the western Indian Ocean, dry weather in the east and wildfires in Australia.\n\nCressman, part of whose job involves looking at historical conditions to understand current developments, said the climate\u2019s behavioural changes made that difficult.\n\n\u201cThis analogous forecasting methodology used to work pretty good up until five years ago, and it\u2019s just not working very well any more at all because of the rainfall, the timing, the distribution.

Feared, persecuted and hunted in every US state where they are found, apart from California, the animal is rarely dangerous to humans and barely seen.

He\u2019s a poster child for what\u2019s going wrong here with mountain lions Beth Pratt, National Wildlife Federation\n\nLast year, a study on the genetic diversity of mountain lions in the Santa Monica and Santa Ana mountains concluded that the species is at risk of local extinction in 50 years unless measures are taken to improve genetic diversity. LA\u2019s road network has created genetic islands of mountain lions, driving rampant inbreeding in the big cats. The busy freeways act as barriers and mountain lions are frequently killed by cars on less busy roads. Researchers also fear the road network drives increased violence between males fighting over territory.\n\nBut all is not lost. There are plans for a 200ft Liberty Canyon wildlife crossing to span the 10-lane 101 freeway out of the city, used by almost 400,000 cars every day. The $85m (\u00a365m) crossing will be the largest in the world when completed, according to conservationists. So far $13.7m has been raised for the project, largely thanks to the celebrity of one cat: Puma-22, AKA P-22 or \u201cthe Brad Pitt of mountain lions\u201d.\n\n\u201cP-22 is a celebrity but he\u2019s not a success story.

Mumbai aside, LA is the only major global city that lives alongside big cats.\n\n\u201cLA is known for its infamous freeways. One of the things that\u2019s happening with P-22 and his relatives is they are likely going to go extinct in the Santa Monica mountains and LA area, especially the population south of the 101 freeway. The reason they\u2019re going to go extinct is that they cannot get across these roadways to find mates outside their family so their genetic diversity is collapsing. These guys need to be able to move freely across this landscape,\u201d Pratt says, explaining the importance of the Liberty Canyon project.\n\nPlay Video 0:26\n\nWere he not a mountain lion, the story of how P-22 became famous in LA would be a cliche. A difficult journey to Hollywood, a sudden rise to stardom and then international fame. The people of LA hear these tales every day. But never about a top carnivore.\n\nThe image of the mountain lion striding purposefully through Griffith Park in the dead of night, the Hollywood sign beaming in the background, is among the most powerful wildlife photos ever taken. P-22 is still there seven years after his march through the darkness was recorded, feasting on the park\u2019s mule deer, coyotes and racoons.\n\n\u201cOnce they found out they had a top predator in their big park, that changed everything,\u201d says photographer Steve Winter, recalling the frenzied reaction to his photo of P-22. He spent months trying to get the perfect shot of the mountain lion under the sign for National Geographic. \u201cIt brought people a little bit closer to the natural world which they didn\u2019t feel like they were because you\u2019re in the greater LA area.\u201d\n\nPhotographer Steve Winter spent months trying to capture this shot of P-22 for National Geographic\n\nAside from the suspicious mauling of a koala at LA Zoo and an incident in 2015 when he startled maintenance workers checking under a porch near his territory, P-22 has barely been seen in the seven years he has lived in Griffith Park. But that has not stopped him becoming a celebrity. P-22 has made front page news, and even has his own day, 22 October, dedicated to him by decree of LA City council. Not since the Incas built their capital Cusco in the shape of a puma has the animal been so revered.\n\nBut he is trapped by urbanisation and development, unlikely to reproduce unless he manages to negotiate two major freeways and survive the relentless LA traffic.\n\nMuch that is known about the mountain lion populations in Santa Monica is thanks to the work of researchers Seth Riley and Jeff Sikich, who have been capturing and tagging the cats since the early 2000s. Both men helped Winter get the famous photograph of P-22. Riley, a wildlife ecologist with the National Park Service, processes the data on lions that biologist Jeff Sikich tracks and captures. Both men know the many of mountain lions they\u2019ve caught inside out, including the problem with inbreeding, which began with P-22\u2019s father, P-1.\n\nBy telling P-22\u2019s story, we can inject a lot of the conservation messages we want to get out to the public Jeff Sikich, researcher\n\nRiley explains: \u201cP-1 was the first male we followed and P-2 the first female. They mated and had a litter of kittens, P-5, P-6, P-7 and P-8. Three out of four of them were killed by other mountain lions, two of them by their father P-1. We think those conflicts are exacerbated by freeways \u2026 but anyway, P6, one of the females from that litter, mated with P-1 and had P-13. So, P-13 was the result of a father and daughter mating.\u201d\n\nIt gets worse and is even a story told by the Top Trump cards created by the Cougars of LA, which were sold to help fund the Liberty Canyon wildlife crossing. The card for P-12, who replaced alpha male P-1 as king of the mountains, tells a grim tale in the \u201ccougar fact\u201d section. It reads: \u201cP-12 brought new genes, but his mating options remain limited. He mated with one of his daughters (twice) and granddaughters (twice).\u201d\n\nIf P-22\u2019s fame helps Liberty Canyon wildlife pass get built, then the future for the area\u2019s mountain lions could change for the better. Sikich, who still regularly catches the most famous mountain lion in Hollywood to check on his health, understands his symbolic importance.\n\n\u201cBy telling P-22\u2019s story, we can inject a lot of the conservation messages we want to get out to the public. Being trapped in this little park, we can talk about habitat fragmentation and the need for corridors.\n\nOne of a litter of four mountain lion kittens found in the Simi Hills by researchers in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe can use this one individual to tell this bigger story to help conserve this species in this area and in other areas,\u201d he adds.\n\nBack in Santa Cruz, King and I are heading to the third and final stop of the day: a kill site he located using tracking data of a mountain lion, 25-F, on the outskirts of Santa Cruz, not far from the beach.

The dam project will affect water levels downstream, depending on how fast Ethiopia fills its 74bn cubic metre reservoir.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ahmed al-Mufti, seen at a 2005 press conference in Khartoum, believes the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam will cause regional instablity.

These are the germs of instability, and it will cause a water war,\u201d he says emphatically. \u201cIf not under this government then under another, as no population will see itself dying of thirst when they know that there is water very close by. This was my position when I quit, and every day since then I find more evidence that supports this.\u201d\n\n\n\nEthiopia is due to begin filling the dam\u2019s reservoir later this year, following a decade of fraught negotiations between the Nile Basin countries. In early April, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, declared that construction would be completed despite the challenges of the pandemic, with the reservoir to be filled during the rainy season that starts in June. \u201cSaving lives is our priority, while second to this we have the Gerd,\u201d he told Ethiopians.\n\nSudan\u2019s prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, proposed \u201cjoint management\u201d of the dam, which will deplete Sudan\u2019s water from the Blue Nile while potentially providing much-needed cheap electricity in future. Further downstream, however, Egypt has long seen the Gerd as an existential threat that could deprive its 100 million people of the water they need to survive in a changing climate. Some Egyptian officials have even discussed bombing the dam.\n\nEthiopia and Sudan say the dam\u2019s hydropower is essential for their citizens to develop and thrive.\n\nMufti fingers prayer beads as he talks: \u201cI believe that within one year of the filling of the dam\u2019s reservoir, shortcomings will start to appear,\u201d he says. \u201cThis dam is endangering rights \u2013 the right to life and the right to work.\u201d\n\nHe also fears the dam itself risks collapse. \u201cThere will be a shortage of water, and a lack of safety of the dam abrogating [the] human right to life of the Sudanese people.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Families gather by the Nile river at Tuti island in Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and the White Nile meet to become the Nile river.

Now, in addition to his human rights work, he spends his days touring farming communities to warn them of the risks of the Gerd and working on a newsletter that follows dam developments in minute detail. He has written several books on the subject. \u201cThis one is intended as a record, so that when things go wrong I can say the information was there,\u201d he says, pushing a paperback over his large desk.\n\n\n\nIn January, the tense discussions between the three nations came to a head in Washington. US-mediated talks had secured a preliminary agreement between the trio, including an understanding that a staged filling process would be undertaken in the wet season. The three countries also said they needed to reach agreement on the later stages, not least on the thorny issue of how to manage during dry times. Much depends on the Blue Nile, which has been impacted by the changing climate.\n\n\n\nWhen Egypt and Sudan returned to Washington to negotiate and sign the final deal in February, Ethiopian negotiators declined to attend, stating that more time was needed to deliberate. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said a final agreement on the dam could take \u201cmonths\u201d to resolve.\n\n\n\nEthiopia\u2019s position fuelled an escalating war of words. Egypt accused Addis Ababa of \u201cintent to exercise hydro-hegemony\u201d, raising the issue with the Arab League and Donald Trump. Ethiopia claimed the US president had \u201cinaccurate and inadequate information\u201d about the issue, while Egypt\u2019s foreign minister conducted a Middle East tour to rally support. Egypt has repeatedly tried to win Sudan over to its position on the dam, even taking steps to end a decades-long border dispute.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Construction work on Ethiopia\u2019s Grand Renaissance dam in Guba woreda, in the Ethiopian region of Benishangul-Gumuz. Photograph: Tiksa Negeri/Reuters\n\nSudan hopes the dam will provide cheap electricity, and has long attempted to strike a balance between Egypt and Ethiopia, attending talks in Washington but declining to sign an Arab League statement condemning Ethiopia. Mufti has seen Sudan\u2019s stance as a fool\u2019s errand, pointing to a declaration of principles signed by the three nations in 2015.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this says is that if there is excess, if, then downstream countries like Sudan will get priority to buy it! If!\u201d he says furiously. \u201cNo specific quantity, no prices, nothing \u2013 if! And the potential generation is expected to be 6,000 megawatts when this was written down, but initially engineers are saying production won\u2019t exceed 2,000, so there will never be excess. If there\u2019s an excess, this will be sold at regular prices \u2013 and right now Egypt is giving Sudan electricity.\u201d\n\nMufti believes that, in the end, regional politics has won, and Sudan has been sold a lie of cheap power. \u201cThis is what has been sold to the Sudanese people \u2013 it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nDry lands\n\nOn the bank of the Blue Nile, farmer Abdullah Ali points at the river. The water doesn\u2019t cover the riverbed, exposing a wide streak of brown sandy earth. Ali has extended a pump from his dry farmland to catch some of the river water closest to the bank, but soon he will have to extend it much further.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The water level has never been this bad before\u2019: Abdullah Ali. Photograph: Ruth Michaelson\n\n\u201cThe water level is down \u2013 even today,\u201d he says. He is 65 and has been a farmer for his entire adult life, but this is new. \u201cIt\u2019s never been this bad before. Last year at this time, the water was plentiful.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Nile offers a terrifying picture of the climate crisis \u2013 not just for Sudan\u2019s water resources but for the entire region. Ali walks over cracked soil as he points at the remaining crops with his cane, his long white robe billowing in the winds.\n\n\n\nAs Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia argue over the Nile Basin\u2019s waters, the climate crisis is encroaching. Ali wants the river to sustain his crops, which this year featured much more alfalfa because it can be grown in dry areas. But this meant fewer profits; alfalfa does not generate as much profit as the tomatoes and okra he sells in Khartoum. The lack of water also meant money was needed for a diesel-powered pump for irrigation.\n\n\n\nHe knows the exposed riverbed means that communities downstream will experience drought. The water levels were so low, he was convinced that the Ethiopian authorities had begun filling the dam\u2019s reservoir, decreasing the flow to the Blue Nile. \u201cI think the dam is affecting us here,\u201d he says, repeating the fears of other local farmers.\n\nThe lack of water is already displacing people. \u201cI know farmers who have given up their land and have moved to work with others who can afford pumps,\u201d says Ali, who fears the same fate if he can\u2019t keep up with the increasing costs. \u201cWe have never been tired like this year. With this amount of water, how can I farm? We don\u2019t go to the government for the solution,\u201d he says bitterly.\n\n\n\nFurther up the bank, cotton farmer Hassan Khallafallah was proud of this year\u2019s crop, but worried about next year. His fields of cotton rustle in the wind, with fluffy white buds stretching up to the clear blue sky.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I\u2019m worried for Sudan\u2019: Hassan Khallafallah. Photograph: Ruth Michaelson\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried for Sudan,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not affected [by the lack of water], but in future I will be.\u201d He is concerned about the Gerd the progress of which he has followed closely in the news.\n\nKhallafallah has already noticed shifting weather patterns and lower water levels in the irrigation channels. On the banks of the main channel that supplies water to his fields, he says: \u201cYou see \u2013 there\u2019s less water in the channel. We expect that after April, there just won\u2019t be enough.\u201d\n\n\n\nKhallafallah has been buoyed by Sudan\u2019s transition to democracy, and says he would like to push the government on the issue of water in future. \u201cThis is a problem for the irrigation ministry. I would go to Khartoum to talk to them.\u201d\n\nHydropower\n\nYet Sudan\u2019s Gerd negotiator, Salih Hamad Hamid, of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources, is confident the country can handle some loss of water resources while reaping the benefits of cheap hydropower.\n\n\u201cSudan seeks to secure its water rights and achieve optimal benefit from the shared Blue Nile waters. The Sudanese proposal optimises the power generation from the Gerd \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s objective \u2013 and minimises harm during filling and operation to both downstream countries of Sudan and Egypt,\u201d he said in a statement to the Guardian.\n\n\n\nHamid stressed that the countries had \u201cagreed on a filling timetable of seven stages. This can increase or decrease from seven years\u201d, according to drought and water levels, lengthening the timetable if the water levels of the Blue Nile are lower than average.\n\n\n\nA shared filling timetable is needed because the dam will create a reservoir twice the size of the Hoover Dam\u2019s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US, decreasing the flow of the Blue Nile by up to 25% and potentially decreasing the power of Egypt\u2019s Aswan dam.\n\nWhile the preliminary agreement mentions potential dry periods, there has been extraordinarily little mention of climate change, an undeniable threat to water resources.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters against the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam in Khartoum, Sudan. Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nSudanese supporters of the dam say the annual rainy season that helps the Nile flood provides more than enough water. In their eyes, the Blue Nile and Sudan have water to spare, which could be traded for hydro electricity.\n\n\n\nBut studies show that Nile Basin countries will be subject to longer dry periods. Scientists from the American Geophysical Union have warned that, \u201cdespite projected increases in regional precipitation due to climate change, the frequency of hot and dry years is likely to also rise due to warming. These increased hot and dry extremes will stress regional agriculture, and coupled with rapid population growth, they will exacerbate water scarcity across the Upper Nile Basin in the coming decades\u201d.\n\n\n\nTwo of those scientists, Ethan Coffel and Justin Mankin, have sounded the alarm about how people are at risk. \u201cAt present, around 10% of the basin\u2019s population faces chronic water scarcity due to the region\u2019s seasonal aridity and highly unequal distribution of water resources,\u201d they said. Water is already a scarce resource in parts of Darfur and other desertified areas of Sudan, with conflict over the precious resource potentially exacerbated by climate change.\n\n\n\nThey warned that by 2040, up to 35% of those living in the Nile Basin countries could be facing water scarcity. \u201cThat\u2019s more than 80 million people without enough water to function in their daily lives,\u201d they said.\n\n'We have no options': how water scarcity is changing south Iraq Read more\n\nOn the Fenti Golf course just outside Khartoum, concerns about water resources appear distant.

The very least that should be done is to ascertain that none of our commitments are used to harm our climate goals.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the global economic recovery is being shaped with meetings this week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, and by the World Bank and IMF. Much of the initial financial aid from governments was rescue packages to prevent immediate economic collapse, but further huge sums are expected to build recovery.\n\nLaurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, who was France\u2019s climate change ambassador when the global Paris climate deal was sealed in 2015, said: \u201cWe know speed is essential with so many lives and livelihoods at stake, but it would be irresponsible to knowingly lock in more human suffering by enabling more pollution.\u201d\n\nLord Stern, a climate economist at the London School of Economics, UK, said: \u201cThe nature and shape of this recovery will determine our future. It is crucial [it] does not lock in our exposure to the great risks of climate change.\u201d But he said it was important to distinguish between rescue packages and recovery packages and not, for example, to withhold support for the workers in high-carbon sectors.\n\nMichael Liebrich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the systems of the past were already failing the world before Covid-19. \u201cAs governments again load the helicopters with money to dump on the global economy \u2026 no fossil fuel-based businesses should be bailed out without committing to science-based, net-zero targets. No money should go to industries that have been living high on the hog on fossil fuel subsidies and tax loopholes, like the airline industry, unless they accept structural reform.\u201d\n\nBen Backwell, CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council, said some governments had extended commissioning deadlines for new wind farms, including those of India, Germany and Greece. \u201cBut so far no government has explicitly included stimulus packages specific to the wind and other renewable sectors. Much diplomatic effort went into brokering the OPEC+ deal to stabilise oil prices but the discussion needs to move on now to ensuring that renewable energy is at the centre of economic recovery plans.\u201d\n\nThe course of the recovery has yet to be decided, according to Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank. \u201cI think it is too soon to say that the battle for funds to rebuild our economy is being won by the polluting sectors of business, especially on climate change.

More significantly, the frequency of drier years is also much greater,\u201d Keelty found.\n\nHe said that peoples\u2019 memories of the river, and much of the expansion in irrigation in the southern basin, had occurred at a time when inflows were greater, between the second world war and the 1990s.\n\n\u201cWhile there may be many factors contributing to the extent of observed inflow reductions, the lack of rainfall and runoff has been the primary driver for the conditions being experienced by many across the Basin in recent times,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cImplications for future trends \u2013 particularly arising from the impacts of climate change \u2013 remain uncertain,\u201d Keelty said, referring to work that is now being done by the CSIRO for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.\n\nKeelty\u2019s findings appear aimed at trying to quell the increasingly toxic debate over management of Australia\u2019s largest river system and to inject more science into it.\n\n\u201cGiven the marked decrease in inflows over the past two decades it is important that the appropriateness of existing arrangements is reassessed in the context of the changes that are occurring and a future that may be characterised by further extremes,\u201d Keelty said.\n\nHe called on governments to stop playing politics with the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.\n\nHe said many of the concerns about the plan were \u201cfuelled by uncertainty, misinformation, misperceptions or misappropriation of available information\u201d and the debate around the plan had become \u201cincreasingly toxic\u201d.\n\nIn remarks that appear to be addressed to New South Wales, Keelty said: \u201c In the absence of strong, Basin-wide leadership, there is a perception that some parties are too busy \u2018playing politics\u2019 and are ineffectual at making any tough decisions \u2013especially when it comes to making decisions in the national interest and at the \u2018whole of Basin\u2019 level.\u201d\n\n\u201cA more unified Basin-wide position and plan of action for Basin Plan implementation is required across all levels of government to improve leadership in the Basin and address the current crisis in confidence,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the reduced flows from the Darling into the Murray, Keelty noted there were multiple factors, including the activities of irrigators in the north, but added the Darling only historically contributed 8% to the Murray\u2019s flows.\n\n\u201cInflows both into the Menindee Lakes and from the Lakes to the River Murray have dramatically reduced in the last 20 years,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere may be numerous factors contributing to this, including record low inflows in northern NSW, lower rainfall, higher temperatures, catchment modification (including farm dams), increasing development, floodplain harvesting, changes in extraction rules in water-sharing plans, and non-compliance,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said the relative influence of each of these factors had not been established and more work by the MDBA was needed.\n\nHe has also called for the MDBA and the states to be more transparent on water sharing and how they manage water accounts so that water users can understand how water is being allocated.\n\nOne of the gripes in the southern basin has come from the dairy industry and other irrigators who rely on less secure water entitlements, which have seen their allocations cut over time. There has also been concerns by Victoria and NSW about allocations to South Australia.\n\n\u201cMany of the concerns that the inquiry heard might have been redundant if individuals were able to readily see and understand the way available water has been shared over time,\u201d Keelty said.\n\n\u201cHolders of NSW General Security and Victorian Low Reliability water share entitlements feel they have been disproportionately affected. There is a high likelihood that historical expectations of reliability are no longer accurate because climatic conditions have changed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUnderpinning many irrigators\u2019 frustrations is also the fact that there is very little data available about the long-term reliability of different entitlement types. This is undermining confidence in the water allocation process,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCoordinated and strategic leadership will help by providing more certainty about water reform in the long-term, which will be beneficial for everyone in the Basin,\u201d he said.\n\n'Triple whammy': drought, fires and floods push Australian rivers into crisis Read more\n\nKeelty also rejected calls to give up environmental water for agriculture during droughts, noting that some of these calls are based on a misconceptions that environmental water gets priority during droughts, when in fact its allocations are reduced in the same way as irrigators\u2019 entitlements are cut.\n\nThe minister for resources, water and northern Australia, Keith Pitt, said he would accept all five of Keelty\u2019s recommendations, which centre on transparency and greater information on how the plan works.\n\nPitt said this was one of three reports that would inform the commonwealth and states in the future management of the Murray-Darling Basin.\n\nThe other two \u2013 the Sefton report on socio-economic conditions in basin communities and the competition regulator\u2019s report on the water market, sparked by allegations of water speculation \u2013 are still to come.

Those whose livelihoods depend on the region are demanding solutions amid fears that rising seas will further threaten the fragile ecosystems of the Mediterranean\u2019s most important wetland.\n\nStorm Gloria brought rain, snow and flooding to most of Spain, but it was the east coast that was hardest hit, with high winds whipping the normally placid Mediterranean with such ferocity that plastic containers of products that haven\u2019t been on the market in decades washed up on Catalan beaches.\n\nThe low-lying Ebro Delta suffered most, as the storm sent waves crashing nearly 30 metres inland, inundating rice fields and irrigation channels with saltwater as far as 3km (2 miles) from the shore.\n\nMussel and oyster farms were badly damaged, while pumping stations essential for maintaining the balance between fresh and saltwater were destroyed. Houses in the town of Deltebre were flooded.\n\n\u201cYou can just imagine the impact of waves as high as nine metres and winds up to 100km per hour hitting a region that is at sea level,\u201d says Gerardo Bonet, president of the Ebro Delta mussel farmers\u2019 association, who estimates the association\u2019s losses at around \u20ac1.6 million (\u00a31.3 million). \u201cNo one has ever seen a storm like this here.\u201d\n\nThe delta produces 4,000 tonnes of mussels and 800 tonnes of oysters a year but 11 of the platforms used to grow the creatures have been destroyed and many others damaged. \u201cWe have to replace and reinforce the structures and also make them higher, because the sea level has risen as a result of climate change,\u201d Bonet says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Many of the structures used to grow oysters and mussels were destroyed. Photograph: Susanna Saez/EPA\n\nAround 15% of the 700,000 tonnes of rice grown in Spain comes from the delta and more than 7,000 acres of rice fields will have to be desalinated and flooded with freshwater before planting can begin in April. Even then, it\u2019s estimated that around 20% of the crop will be lost.\n\nAccording to rice farmer Ra\u00fcl Arqu\u00e9s, the real danger is another storm coming before they can rebuild what Gloria washed away. \u201cAt the moment we have no defences, nothing to keep the sea out.\u201d\n\nWhile Gloria represents the sharp end of the threat from the climate crisis, for decades the delta\u2019s fragile ecology has suffered from a combination of political neglect and over-exploitation of the river. The Ebro, which gave Iberia its name, is the only major Spanish river that flows into the Mediterranean. Its waters are much in demand for irrigation and hydro-electricity and there are 181 dams along its 930km course from Cantabria to the sea.\n\nAs Bonet puts it, \u201cthe delta is a balance between the river and the sea and for some time now the sea has been winning\u201d.\n\nHe says the river\u2019s flow into the delta has fallen by half since the 1990s.\n\nOne effect of all those dams is to drastically reduce the amount of sediment that reaches the delta. The sediment is an essential element of the local ecology and also protects the shoreline from erosion. In some areas the shoreline is receding by more than five metres a year.\n\nNot enough sediment or water is getting to the delta, says Joan Francesc Vidal, director of the Ebro Delta nature reserve, which is home to around 95 species of birds and a stopover for around 300 migrating species.\n\nHow the 'Venice of Africa' is losing its battle against the rising ocean Read more\n\nVidal believes the solution lies in forcing the companies that generate electricity to release more sediment, and redistributing the sand that storms shift northwards back to the southern beaches.\n\n\u201cThere are a range of views on how to solve the problem, from building underwater defences to simply letting nature take its course,\u201d Vidal says.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I believe redistributing the sand is the least disruptive and cheapest.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Proposed solutions include redistributing sand moved by the storm.

Figures have suggested that in July alone surface ice declined by 197 gigatonnes \u2013 equivalent to about 80 million Olympic swimming pools.\n\nNow experts have examined the level of melting in more detail, revealing what drove it. Crucially, the team note, the high pressure conditions lasted for 63 of the 92 summer days in 2019, compared with an average of just 28 days between 1981 and 2010. A similar situation was seen in 2012, a record bad year for melting of the ice sheet.\n\nThe team say the climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not taken into account such unusual conditions. If such high pressure zones become a regular annual feature, future melting could be twice as high as currently predicted, a result that could have serious consequences for sea level rise.\n\n\u201cThis melt event is a good alarm signal that we urgently need to change our way of living to hold [back] global warming because it is likely that the IPCC projections could be too optimistic for [the] Arctic,\u201d said Dr Xavier Fettweis, co-author of the research from the University of Liege, adding that the atmospheric conditions were unlikely to be down to natural climatic variability and could be driven by global heating.\n\nWriting in the journal the Cryosphere, Fettweis and his co-author Marco Tedesco from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University report how they used satellite data, climate models and global weather patterns to explore the melting of the surface of the ice sheet last year.\n\nAmong their findings the team report that almost 96% of the ice sheet underwent melting at some time in 2019, compared with an average of just over 64% between 1981 and 2010.\n\nUsing models, the pair also found that about 560Gt of meltwater runoff was generated in the summer of 2019. The surface mass balance, the amount of ice the sheet gained from rain and snowfall minus the amount lost through meltwater run off and evaporation, was just 54Gt a year\u2013 about 320Gt a year lower than the average across the earlier decades, and the greatest such drop on record.\n\nFurther analysis showed the level and distribution of melting to be closely tied to a number of factors, including levels of snowfall and reflection of sunlight \u2013 known as albedo \u2013 as well as cloudiness and absorption of sunlight. All of these, they note, were influenced by the persistent high pressure zone over the ice sheet last summer.\n\nDr Poul Christoffersen, a glaciologist at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research, noting only 2012 had a higher meltwater runoff in recent years.\n\n\u201cClearly, this shows that extreme melt events are becoming a lot more frequent,\u201d he said, adding that the new study showed that persistent atmospheric high pressure was an important factor, resulting in clear skies and a lack of snowfall in the south and warm, moist air being brought to northern parts of the ice sheet. \u201cIn that sense, the extreme melt years can be seen as natural events exacerbated by climate change,\u201d said Christoffersen.\n\nProf Andy Shepherd from the University of Leeds said a fall in surface mass balance was concerning. \u201cIf that drops below zero, then the ice sheet is no longer viable because in every year it is losing more ice than it gains,\u201d he said, adding that that was not even counting the loss of icebergs. \u201cEven if the glaciers stopped flowing, which is not going to happen, it would mean that the ice sheet still can\u2019t survive,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}, "se78": {"text": "In the name of freedom, we have been exposed, to a greater extent than any other European nation, to a deadly pandemic. In his speech in Greenwich on 3 February, Boris Johnson lambasted governments that had \u201cpanicked\u201d about the coronavirus, inflicting \u201cunnecessary economic damage\u201d. His government, by contrast, would champion our right to \u201cbuy and sell freely among each other\u201d.\n\nBut as always, the professed love of freedom among those who represent the interests of the rich in politics is highly selective. If the government valued freedom as much as it says it does, it would do everything in its power to maximise the liberties we can safely exercise, while protecting us from harm.\n\nIn other words, it would take up the call to open London\u2019s golf courses to public access. As the author and land campaigner Guy Shrubsole has discovered, there are 131 golf courses in Greater London, covering 11,000 acres. But they are open only to those who pay fees to play and to members, while millions of people swelter in tiny flats or edge round each other in minuscule parks, desperate for a sense of space and freedom. The government would also take up the call for private schools to open their playing fields and extensive grounds. And it would open London\u2019s locked green squares, and designate other tracts of private land in and around our cities for public access.\n\nBut a core purpose of conservatism is to defend private property from public use, and to extend private ownership and exclusive rights into realms previously enjoyed by all. And no form of wealth is more fiercely contested than land.\n\nThroughout the history of these isles, exclusion from the land has been a major source of social conflict. It remains so today. Last month, Johnson extolled the \u201cancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom\u201d. But before the pandemic began, his government proposed to criminalise trespass in England and Wales. This is the opposite policy to Scotland\u2019s, where there is now a comprehensive right to roam.\n\nIn November last year, Johnson announced an expansion of police powers to stop and search people without grounds for suspicion. These powers have long been perceived by people of colour as a form of collective harassment in public places, impinging on their free movement. Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are on average eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people.\n\nSome young black men have the sense of living in a permanent state of partial lockdown. The government\u2019s own assessment shows that an expansion of stop and search powers has \u201cat best, only minimal effects on violent crime\u201d. In fact, as a primary cause of both the 1981 and 2011 riots, the policy is likely to exacerbate it.\n\nUntil 1984, police stop and search powers were exercised under the remarkably brutal 1824 Vagrancy Act. Beggars, hawkers, sex workers, Gypsies and Travellers, rough sleepers and anyone \u201cnot giving a good account of himself or herself\u201d could be arrested and summarily sentenced to three months\u2019 hard labour. Astonishingly, large sections of this barbaric law remain in force , and it is still sometimes used by the police against homeless people.\n\nPolice powers to move people on are necessary during this pandemic. But well into the first half of the 20th century, they were used as a form of social control, securing public space for \u201cthe right sort\u201d, while excluding \u201cundesirables\u201d. They were a source of great resentment in Victorian England, and commemorated in several satirical ballads, various of which had the title Move on There. One song complains that \u201cswells\u201d (rich and extravagant young men) could get away with anything, while those without the means to bribe the police were \u201ccollared\u201d.\n\nToday, much of what looks like public space in our cities is in fact privately owned. Many of these pseudo-public spaces are patrolled by security guards, enforcing opaque rules. As a homeless man interviewed by the Guardian observed, most people wouldn\u2019t notice the difference between a publicly and privately owned open space. But \u201cto me, the difference is everything, because I\u2019m not the sort of person they want over there\u201d. Typically, in these places, homeless people are moved on, no music or photography is allowed, and political gatherings are banned. In some of them, the only acceptable activity appears to be spending money.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting parallel with urban parks in the 19th century, many of which were also then privately owned. As the historian Katrina Navickas documents, the owners typically banned music and political meetings. The Salvation Army, then an extreme temperance movement, waged its wars against people enjoying themselves in any public places, sparking confrontations that sometimes turned violent.\n\nLast year, the Guardian revealed that some London housing estates were excluding children in social housing from playgrounds used by richer residents. The developers of one estate had been granted planning permission on the grounds that its playground would be available to all, after which it replaced a gate with an impenetrable hedge to shut out the poorest residents.\n\nWe might look for freedom in the countryside, but for centuries it has been the scene of extreme exclusion and injustice. Here, enclosure (the seizure of land from commoners) violently deprived many people of their liberties. The labouring poor were forbidden to live in \u201cclose parishes\u201d, where their homes were ripped down by the lords of the manor, to avoid liability for poverty relief. As a result, until the late 19th century in some places, people were crowded into filthy, dilapidated cottages sometimes an hour\u2019s walk from the fields in which they worked, for which they were charged astounding rents.\n\nNo matter how this coronavirus crisis ends, it will be bad for conservatism | Zoe Williams Read more\n\nToday, we have no right of access to 92% of England. The great majority of the accessible land is in the north-west of the country, a long way from where most people live. While in London four times as many BAME people are stopped and searched as white people, in Suffolk they are 17 times more likely to be stopped, and in Dorset, 25 times. Is it any wonder that, despite government efforts at persuasion, so few people of colour visit the countryside?\n\nFor the moment, our freedoms have to be restricted. But when the lockdown ends, let\u2019s celebrate by demanding a right to roam on open land in both cities and the countryside.

Environmentalists fear their presence correlates with spikes in numbers of dolphins washing up dead.\n\nUse of the ships is heavily regulated in some countries, as trawling has been criticised for the physical damage it inflicts on seabeds, but under the common fisheries policy, EU-registered vessels are legally entitled to fish in UK waters, subject to licence conditions, quota allocation and relevant fishing restrictions.\n\nHow a no-take zone revived a Scottish fishery devastated by dredgers Read more\n\nCampaigners fear supertrawlers are incompatible with sustainable management of fisheries and argue that the UK\u2019s departure from the EU presents an opportunity for a new approach, as fishing rights to British waters are up for review.\n\n\u201cOur government likes to boast about its credentials as a global oceans champion, but what about protecting our seas here at home?\u201d said Chris Thorne, Greenpeace\u2019s oceans campaigner.\n\n\u201cMinisters should take a long, hard look at whether allowing supertrawlers to operate in UK waters is compatible with sustainable management of our waters, as well as investigating the impact of the UK\u2019s industrial distant-water fleet in other countries\u2019 waters.\u201d\n\nCalls for a ban on supertrawlers were made last year when the Lithuanian-registered Margiris \u2013 a 142-metre (465ft) boat with a deadweight of 6,200 tonnes, once considered the second largest in the world and banned from Australian waters \u2013 spent time off the south coast of England.\n\nAccording to analysis by Greenpeace, Margiris was fishing in an area of the Channel designated by the government as a marine conservation zone. However, the government said it was monitored closely and no infringements were found.\n\nThe overall number of voyages in UK waters by supertrawlers each year is unclear, but conservationists claim that anecdotal evidence suggests the ships wreak havoc on sea life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a long stream of dolphin deaths, I have never seen anything quite like it,\u201d said John Hourston, from the Blue Planet Society. \u201cWe have had several storms but dolphins do not die because of weather, they are great swimmers.\u201d\n\nHe believes the evidence points to supertrawlers being responsible for an increase in stranded dolphins off the Sussex coast and the west of Ireland, but that scientific study is needed to incontrovertibly prove the link.\n\n\u201cWe have just got mass dolphin die-offs and mass fishing fleets and the two correlate, but we need more evidence.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, he said, these ships should fitted with CCTV cameras or have independent observers on board to monitor which fish are being caught.\n\n\u201cI am not talking about the inshore fishermen, I am talking about the industrial supertrawler fleets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not be allowing supertrawlers in British waters.\u201d\n\nFrench campaigners have also highlighted how rising numbers of dead dolphins are being washed up on the coast of the Bay of Biscay after becoming caught up in large trawler nets. In 2017, researchers said the number of dead dolphins washing up on British and French shores was at its highest level in more than 14 years, echoing observations from Ireland.\n\nThe website of fishing company Parlevliet & Van der Plas, the owner of the Margiris, says it has an \u201cexcellent reputation for sustainable fishing\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cOur catch quotas are dictated by government and EU regulations, and are based on scientific advice.

Gas is sometimes called on by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) to boost grid security, but Saddler said this role was expected to decline as new transmission interconnection was built between states and regions.\n\nHe said the idea gas would be a transition fuel in the Australian market was nearly 20 years out of date. \u201cThe ISP results [from Aemo\u2019s integrated system plan for the grid] show very clearly there is a transition from coal to renewables without going via gas under all the scenarios,\u201d Saddler said.\n\nA spokesman for the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the Aemo modelling highlighted demand for gas generation as a balance to variable renewable generation was expected to increase. He emphasised that the gas projects shortlisted for the government underwriting program were not combined cycle plants, but \u201chighly flexible, fast start\u201d technology that were particularly well suited to complementing renewable energy.\n\nSaddler said the first point was misleading. He said the Aemo modelling suggested gas generation would decline over the next decade even as coal plants closed before rebounding in the late 2030s to a level that would still be less than today.\n\nSaddler said the flexible gas plants already in the grid were also running well below capacity. He pointed to 31 January this year, the second highest day for electricity demand on record, when the maximum gas generation from both combined-cycle and flexible generators reached 7.6 gigawatts, well below the grid\u2019s total gas-fired capacity of 11.4 gigawatts .\n\nRichie Merzian, Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy director, said the grid\u2019s gas plants were mostly built 10 to 20 years ago, when it was assumed the price of gas would come down and that gas would play a significant role as a transition fuel during the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy.\n\n\u201cIn reality, gas is expensive, it\u2019s high-polluting and, as this research shows, it is under-performing,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven this, why would we underwrite new gas-fired plants?\u201d\n\nGas-fired power is usually said to have about half the emissions of coal-fired generation, but some studies have found this does not factor in the amount of methane \u2013 a highly potent, but relatively short-lived, greenhouse gas \u2013 that leaks into the atmosphere during extraction and from pipelines.\n\nAccording to Aemo\u2019s modelling, the grid is likely to need between 5 gigawatts and 21 gigawatts of new \u201cflexible, dispatchable\u201d generation by 2040. It lists large-scale pumped hydro and battery storage, small-scale batteries and demand reductions programs as likely sources.\n\nIt found new, flexible gas generators could also play a role \u201cif gas prices materially reduce\u201d. The wholesale price of gas has roughly tripled over the past decade.\n\nTaylor\u2019s spokesman cited a recent grid report card by the government\u2019s Energy Security Board that raised concerns about maintaining security and reliability when wind and solar were not available. \u201cThe government has consistently prioritised action to encourage new, reliable supply, including pumped hydro, like Snowy 2.0, and [flexible] gas,\u201d he said.\n\nTony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, said the underwriting program was a bad idea as it distorted the market and discouraged private investment, and a carbon price remained the best way to drive a shift to net zero emissions.\n\nHe said gas was likely to play a role in the transition to a clean grid, but decisions on whether to invest in gas, or any technology, were best made by energy companies in the context of a clear climate policy.\n\n\u201cThen if people want to invest in new gas-fired power stations to balance the system and they are prepared to pay for that and think they can make that work, I don\u2019t see any reason why they shouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Wood said. \u201cBut the government shouldn\u2019t be paying for it or underwriting it.\u201d", "label": 0}, "se81": {"text": "From a stately Scottish elm to a might Russian oak, competitors for the title of European tree of the year do their nations proud\n\nThe Guardian of the Flooded Village\n\nLast week, a pine tree near a flooded Czech village was voted European tree of the year.

In tests with bags of chips in seaside towns, she found that staring the birds out put them off their daring raids.\n\nTo follow up that work, Goumas wanted to see whether gulls pick up on subtle human cues to help them find their next meal. And so she set off to the Cornish towns of Falmouth, St Ives, Newquay and Penzance, and Plymouth in Devon, armed with shop-bought flapjacks in shiny blue wrappers, a supply of blue sponges, and a pair of dark glasses.\n\nFor the first experiment, Goumas donned the sunglasses and walked towards her chosen bird, carrying a bucket with a flapjack in each hand. When she was about eight metres from the gull, she sat down, flipped the buckets over so they concealed the snacks, and pushed them out to her sides. She then lifted off the buckets, picked up one of the flapjacks, stood up and pretended to eat it. After 20 seconds, she put the flapjack back and retreated a safe distance.\n\nGoumas, who wore the sunglasses to avoid deterring the birds with her gaze, recorded what the gulls did next. Out of 38 birds singled out for tests, 24 approached and pecked at the flapjacks. Of these, 19 \u2013 or 74% pecked at the flapjack she had recently handled. The results suggest that the birds paid attention when she pretended to eat the snack.\n\nTo see whether the effect held true for other items, Goumas set off to different parts of the towns in search of more gulls. Once in place, she performed the same experiment but substituted the flapjacks for little blue sponges. This time, the gulls pecked both the handled and unhandled items roughly equally.\n\n\u201cSeagulls have made an association between humans and food and the reason for that is probably that we\u2019re not disposing of our food properly when we\u2019ve finished it,\u201d Goumas said.

Inner-city residents may see a bird of prey overhead for the first time, or notice flashes of colour from butterflies which usually shun their gardens.\n\nAnimals are moving into the spaces that humans have vacated, and we are unusually receptive to their arrival. When days seem so indistinct, the appearance of a new bird in a backyard suddenly seizes our attention. A morning walk through a quiet park may have replaced a commute on a packed bus. Birdsong is clearer now that the traffic has hushed.\n\nWith quieter roads, the death toll of hedgehogs and other creatures is expected to fall. Grass verges, left uncut, will provide a home for wildflowers and a breeding ground for bugs and insects.

Nor is all the real news good. Much work to protect wildlife has slowed or stopped due to social distancing measures, and the nature conservation sector, often strapped for cash, is under increased pressure. In developing countries, the absence of tourism and monitoring groups may give a free rein to loggers and poachers who will see no more need to obey quarantine rules than any other laws. People already living close to the edge may be forced to exploit nature to survive as their work disappears.\n\nNot all towns and cities are as blessed with parks as many British ones are, and even in the UK, the quantity and quality of green space varies widely. We have never thought so much about it: the lockdown is a painful reminder that people in deprived areas and those from BAME backgrounds have less access to public parks as well as being less likely to have private gardens. This is not inevitable. Both pocket parks and larger expanses can improve the mental and physical health of their users. Access to nature should not be a privilege.\n\nWhen the pandemic is finally over, wildlife may vanish as fast as it emerged \u2013 and we may not really notice. The need to feed families may soon subsume broader considerations of wellbeing. Yet this strange and frightening interlude is reminding us that there may be better ways to arrange our lives.

It reports rebounding sea life, from humpback whales off Australia to elephant seals in the US and green turtles in Japan.\n\nThrough rampant overfishing, pollution and coastal destruction, humanity has inflicted severe damage on the oceans and its inhabitants for centuries. But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas.\n\nThe scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world\u2019s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high.\n\nHowever, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels.\n\n\u201cWe have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,\u201d said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. \u201cFailing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.\u201d\n\nProf Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review\u2019s international team, said: \u201cOverfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration.\n\n\u201cOne of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back. We can turn the oceans around and we know it makes sense economically, for human wellbeing and, of course, for the environment.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fishing below an ocean\u2019s maximum yield allows faster recovery of fish stocks. Photograph: Manu San Felix/NG/KAUST\n\nThe review, published in the journal Nature, found that global fishing is slowly becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In places from Tampa Bay, Florida to the Philippines, the habitats are being restored.\n\nAmong the success stories are humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica to eastern Australia, whose populations have surged from a few hundred animals in 1968, before whaling was banned, to more than 40,000 today. Sea otters in western Canada have risen from just dozens in 1980 to thousands now. In the Baltic Sea, both grey seal and cormorant populations are soaring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to appreciate the value of what we\u2019re losing and not just in terms of intrinsic beauty of the wildlife but in terms of protecting our livelihoods and societies from bad things happening, whether that be poor water quality in rivers and oceans or sea level rise beating on the doorstep of coastal areas,\u201d said Roberts.\n\nHowever, progress is far from straightforward. Pollution from farms and plastics still pours into the oceans, the waters are reaching record high temperatures, and destructive fishing is still taking place in many places, with at least one-third of fish stocks overexploited.\n\n\u201cThe Mediterranean is still pretty much a basket case,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cAnd there is horrendous overfishing throughout large parts of south-east Asia and India, where fisheries are just catching anything they trawl on the seabed to render into fish meal and oil.\u201d\n\nThe global heating of the oceans has driven the few hundred surviving northern right whales along the coast of the western Atlantic. Here, amid busy shipping lanes and lobster fisheries, they are killed by collisions or drowned in a tangle of ropes, according to Roberts, though new regulations are starting to help.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico suffers massive dead zones owing to huge amounts of manure and fertiliser running off midwest farms, and elsewhere albatrosses continue to be snared by long-line fishers, despite simple solutions being available.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Healthy coral reefs are highly productive and support high biomasses of top predators. Photograph: Manu San Felix/NG/KAUST\n\nBut examples of the benefits of restorative habits were growing, Roberts said, from the return of once abundant oyster beds that can clean huge volumes of water, to marine protected areas that can boost fishery catches nearby, such as by the Scottish island of Arran.\n\n\u201cWhen I started working on the science of marine protected areas in the early 1990s. it was very much a niche interest,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cNow it\u2019s being discussed at the top level internationally and we have many countries signing up to expand protection to 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030, with the UK among the early adopters of the target.\u201d Marine protected areas have risen from 0.9% of the ocean in 2000 to 7.4% now, though not all are fully implemented.\n\nThe scientists\u2019s review concludes that restoring the oceans by 2050 is a grand challenge that, with a global redoubling of conservation efforts, can be achieved: \u201cMeeting the challenge would be a historic milestone in humanity\u2019s quest to achieve a globally sustainable future.\u201d", "label": 0}, "se93": {"text": "Shutdown of SSE and RWE plants comes before UK ban on coal-fired power from 2025\n\nThis article is more than 4 weeks old\n\nThis article is more than 4 weeks old\n\nThe energy corporations SSE and RWE have shut the door on coal-fired power generation by closing the Fiddler\u2019s Ferry power station in Warrington, Cheshire, and the Aberthaw coal plant in Wales after almost 50 years.\n\nThe Fiddler\u2019s Ferry power plant began generating enough electricity to power 2m homes in 1973 and is officially closing on Tuesday.

Before the lockdown, half of all food and drink was consumed outside the home, and switching from supplying big catering companies and distributors has been proving difficult.\n\nBut some farmers and food entrepreneurs are finding now is their time to shine, and the environmental benefits \u2013 and the profits \u2013 may encourage more to follow suit.\n\nTwo years ago Neil Stephen, from Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, invested in self-service vending machines dispensing everything from farmhouse cheese and shortbread (baked by his mother), to joints of meat, whole chickens and fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\nHe was inspired by his grandfather who, in the late 1970s, used to leave a wheelbarrow at the gates of the family farm filled with turnips and cabbages, and an honesty box for people to pay.\n\nNow Stephen\u2019s investment is paying off, as people are attracted to a hygienic system where the goods are neatly packaged in portions in a refrigerated unit, behind glass doors. They punch in the number, pay by card and the windows open for them to collect the goods.\n\nSales at Thorneybank Farm Shop are up fivefold, Stephen reports. \u201cWe were rushed off our feet. It\u2019s worked phenomenally, it\u2019s been stratospheric.\u201d\n\nThe shop sells produce from neighbouring farmers, too, with asparagus and strawberries coming from six miles away, and eggs and dairy from three miles down the road. They can make better profit margins than they would selling to a big supermarket, without the hassle of door-to-door deliveries. The shop has a strong social media presence, and shoppers come from nearby Turriff town, while the city of Aberdeen is about 30 miles away.\n\nFishing is another industry hard hit by the Covid-19 crisis. In normal times, most of Britain\u2019s catch is destined for overseas markets, from China to Spain, where the species commonly caught in UK waters appeal to consumers\u2019 tastes. People in the UK have proved reluctant to move beyond cod, haddock and tuna, which mostly has to be imported.\n\nThe government has now announced \u00a31m for English fishermen to set up new ways to sell their catch and find local markets. There are already schemes for distributing fresh-caught fish directly, such as SoleShare in London and Call4Fish, a service that operates from Berwickshire to Cornwall.\n\nFood campaigners hope these services, where the fish on offer depends on what is caught by small boats, will encourage a more sustainable way of fishing, as consumers experiment with species less overfished than cod that might not previously have found a market.\n\nOne Londoner, Sebastien Sainsbury used to work in the investment banks that tower over Canary Wharf in London. Now he has a company, Plate to Crate, growing salad and other leafy greens in hydroponic towers in shipping containers, stacked up in air conditioned units under heat lamps with conditions carefully monitored.\n\nThe containers seem more like labs than farms, with workers kitted out in protective gear, from boot shields to hairnets, to prevent pests getting in. As a result, the lettuce, kale, pak choi and herbs are free from pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, and water use is 96% lower than in fields, with wastewater being used on local lawns.\n\nThe first harvest is due in May and, once all of the units are fully up and running, there could be 12 harvests a year, producing 15 to 18 tonnes from this site. Another will be producing soon in London\u2019s Elephant and Castle, where a development of 3,000 homes will receive salad weekly from containers.\n\nSainsbury believes this is the future of fresh produce for fussy Londoners. \u201cYounger people are more focused on where their food comes from, how fresh it is, what\u2019s in it. This coronavirus crisis is an opportunity for us all to become aware of what we are eating.\u201d", "label": 0}, "se99": {"text": "The Sahara\u2019s shift from savannah with abundant lakes to a largely arid expanse has been traced in the remains of fish eaten thousands of years ago.\n\nResearchers analysing material found in a rock shelter in the Acacus mountains in south-west Libya say they have found more than 17,500 animal remains dating from between 10,200 and 4,650 years ago, 80% of which are fish. About two-thirds of the fish were catfish and the rest were tilapia. The team say telltale marks on the bones reveal the fish were eaten by humans who used the shelter.\n\nIt is not the first time fish remains have been found in what are now dry regions of the desert, but the team say it is the first time the ancient climate of the region has been traced through animal remains.\n\n\u201cAll the other finds are surface finds, [from] just one layer, one period, one event. Whereas what we have here is a 5,000-year sequence with a lot of bones \u2013 so that makes it special,\u201d said Dr Wim van Neer from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, a co-author of the study.\n\nThe discovery is the latest in a string of finds from the large Takarkori rock shelter, a site, about 50-60 metres long and 30 metres high, that is thought to have been first used by hunter gatherers more than 10,000 years ago.\n\nProf Savino di Lernia, a co-author of the study from Sapienza University of Rome, said previous finds at the shelter included evidence of rock art, the earliest signs in Africa of wild cereals being cultivated and their seeds stored, and evidence from pottery shards of dairy practices in Africa dating back nearly 7,000 years ago.\n\nNaturally mummified human remains of Neolithic pastoralists have also been discovered at the shelter, while the uppermost layers of the site are composed of dung left by the animals of nomadic herders that later camped at the site between 5,900 and 4,650 years ago.\n\nWriting in the journal Plos One, Van Neer and colleagues report that fish account for about 80% of the animal remains discovered at the site during the 5,000-year period it was used by humans, with mammals making up just over 19%. Birds molluscs and other animals such as turtles account for the rest.\n\nThe team found the predominance of fish was not steady but fell from about 90% in the earliest layers to about 48% in those from the most recent period of its occupation.\n\n\u201cThe amount of fish is decreasing through time and the contribution of mammals increases, showing that people at Takarkori focussed gradually more on hunting and livestock keeping,\u201d the authors write. But, they add: \u201cIt is unclear if this was an intentional process or if this shift could be related to increasing aridity, which made the environment less favourable for fishes.\u201d\n\nThe findings chime with previous evidence from the Sahara, including from sediments and geological features, that have highlighted a shift in the climate from a wetter environment with vegetation and abundant lakes more than 10,000 years ago, to a period of fluctuating dry and wet conditions, until about 5,500 years ago the region became increasingly arid, resulting in the landscape seen today.\n\n\u201c[As it became drier] it is possible [there] was more distance that had to be covered to exploit these fish, and that is why we have a decrease,\u201d said Van Neer. \u201cPeople are opportunistic \u2013 if it is easy to get they take it.\u201d\n\nDr Clayton Magill of Heriot-Watt University, who was not part of the research team but previously explored climate change in the African savannah, said the shift to desert conditions in the Sahara region was one of the most remarkable ecological transitions in the Earth\u2019s recent past.\n\nThe new study, he said, showed that such large-scale climate change could affect species differently and increased our understanding of our human ancestors and their relationship with the climate. \u201c[The study] links climate change with changes in culture, whether related to subsistence strategies or social behaviour, thus marking a shift towards coupled human and natural landscapes in which humans are affected by and, in turn, affect their environments,\u201d he said.", "label": 0}}
